With npm, you now have thousands of colleagues you have to coordinate with, without ever speaking to them, getting to know them, or even knowing if they're still alive. And it's all built on blind-trust in all that is Open-Source. How insane is that?

Even if you spent the hundreds of hours needed to evaluate every last one of those dependencies, you still don't know what the developer team behind that dependency wants to do (or doesn't want to do) next. They might be building a beautiful, error-free dependency and tomorrow decide that they want to usurp it for malicious purposes. Or outright delete it, as in the case of Azer and left-pad. I believe dependency-overload to be a common problem to a lot of programming languages, but blind-trust is something special to web development, for reasons still unknown to me. A language I'm diving into lately, Rust, seems to run a tighter ship. Rust dependencies have to be installed very intentionally, and if they go unused your compiler will throw a warning at you. And perhaps it's because of the nature of the projects I'm working on, but the dependencies I do end up using serve a very clear purpose, and solve a problem that would be much too time-consuming for me to solve on my own.\"))), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Javascript seems to lack the technical rigor that other languages inherently possess, and I wonder if it comes down to the fact that the language itself was invented haphazardly, and deceptively.

This deception continues to manifest itself today - visiting any Javascript framework's website is like ...(analogy???)...the websites all seem so polished and fancy, it's very hard to get any real concrete or technical details about why their particular framework is so good, the whole site looks childish and gimmicky...keep thinking on this one\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"This one might be a stretch, but maybe programming communities exhibit their own version of \", \"[imprint theory]\", \"(\", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprinting_(organizational_theory)\"\n  }, \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprinting_(organizational_theory)\"), \", where the environment that the language was born in influences the community that uses it well beyond its early days.
