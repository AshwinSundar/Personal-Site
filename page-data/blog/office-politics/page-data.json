Not playing politics is a form of politics, too. When people say things like \\\"I don't participate in office politics,\\\" that means they are refusing to participate in a set of informal rules, and abiding by their own set of what they believe to be internal rules for interacting with colleagues. The thing is, if enough people start to think like that, well that's the new \\\"office politics\\\" playground.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Another observation I've made is about people who claim to participate in office politics and drop \\\"leads\\\" in the form of what amounts to company gossip. Those people are generally perceived to be intelligent in a company. People who don't participate in office politics can also be seen as intelligent, if they are still openly aware of what the company is doing. The people who are unaware of office politics are generally seen as dumb. Interestingly, the people who are aware of office politics but do not let people know what they know are also seen as dumb.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"But that last group of people retain the most power.

Hiding from everyone and being vague is kinda pointless. Letting a few people know what you know, but keeping things relatively tight-lipped, is a good way to exchange a little bit of knowledge in order for some people to see you as intelligent. You do dilute your knowledge power a bit, but you exchange it for perceived intelligence.

Traditionally, we'd think of those who sell equipment and machinery as the arbitrageurs. But that's just one form. Another form is you and I. When you go to work for a company, you're engaging in arbitrage. You are exchanging your time and knowledge for a promise of a paycheck. It's a brilliant strategy by companies. They have you sign an NDA, which means they have a monopoly over your time and money. And in exchange they just PROMISE they'll pay you. They don't have to. They can stop paying you. They would take a hit in reputation and lose money long-term if people file lawsuits, but they can do that.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"Mental Connections\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Mental connections and big picture ideas ebb and flow.
