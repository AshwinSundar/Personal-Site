This presented a challenge - I needed to store the outcomes of every single professional basketball game that's ever been played in one location so that I could start analyzing data and finding trends. And that's exactly what I did - I wrote an R script (getNBAgames.R) that builds a key-value pair of season:months, builds the URL where the games for that month are located, and then goes to that URL, gets the HTML table, converts it to a dataframe, and saves it as an R object.
