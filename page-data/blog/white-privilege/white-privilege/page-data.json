I was at the gym, G1 fitness (great climbing gym). I start out with a short climbing workout, and then go to the weight room to finish up my workout. I do this about twice a week. Anyway, I walked into the weight room and first off it felt way too crowded for the time and day of the week, which 4PM on a Wednesday. Most people haven't gotten off work yet, which I why I like going a bit early to beat the rush. The last few times I gone, I had the whole weight room to myself. But this time, there were like 8 people (it felt like) in the room. And all just taking up weird amounts of space and doing bizarre exercises. I sighed a little and just walked in anyway, and started off with the free weights (today's focus was triceps and biceps). I couldn't get to some of the free weights because a man was doing some sort of weird crawling exercise, like he was doing a weird spiderman ab workout but also moving in around at the same time. It took up a inordinate amount of space in a not very big weight room, so this annoyed me. I grabbed some 40s to start an overhead tricep press, and as I'm part way through the set I see his wife in the mirror begin a squat workout, and a man on a machine close by suddenly apologized and moved away in a bit of an exaggerated manner. He kept talking for a bit longer than I thought was necessary for that interaction, but thought nothing of it. As I start my second set, I see the wife start her squat workout and before she begins her first rep, calls to her husband, \\\"Mark? Can you lower the pegs for me?\\\" She was referring the pegs on which you rest the bar between sets. Mark was on to some other bizarre ineffectual workout, and merely let out a limp \\\"what?\\\", to which she replied, \\\"Nothing...\\\". That was weird, but whatever.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"What happens next freaks the living hell out of me.
