# The Precursor to Programming Languages

In 19XX, Alonzo Church, a mathematician at Princeton University, was looking for ... (motivation and lambda calculus) and developed the lambda calculus. 

Interestingly, Church was Alan Turing's Ph.D advisor as well. 

For Church, a function represented a black box that transformed x into an output y. It could also transform 2 inputs x1 and x2 and transform them into one output y.

## Notation
See ~3:00 in Computerphile video

## Key Points
1) You can encode anything in lambda calculus. Any program can be written purely using lambda calculus
2) Can be regarded as basis of functional programming
3)
