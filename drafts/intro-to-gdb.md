# Introduction to GNU Debugger for C++


## Introduction
- some stat maybe
- Effective debugging is one of the first tools that should be honed when a programmer approaches a new programming language or codebase. In this article we will use how effectively use the GNU Debugger, or gdb, for C++ effectively.

## Motivation
- Why use GNU debugger? Why not something more modern? Why not really on IDE debugging? You can do all those things, but sometimes it pays to learn old-school tools (why though??). j

## Usage
- create simple program first that we can debug
- simple navigation
- keyboard shortcuts (maybe a table of the top 10 I use most frequently)

## Debugging simple programs

## Debugging larger codebases
- Tips for approaching this situation - try to focus on the smallest possible problem, and then branch out. Approach debugging scientificaly, not stochastically. Computer science is a form of applied math at the end of the day, and the way your program behaves is always deterministic, even if a bug seems to appear randomly. So always remember that when you're on hour 3 or even day 3 of a deep debugging session.
