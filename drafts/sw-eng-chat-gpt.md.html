Programming Efficiency with GPT-3</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Programming can be a complex and cognitively demanding task,
involving various intellectual gymnastics such as debugging code and
memorizing syntaxes across different languages. To manage this cognitive
load and improve efficiency, programmers need strategies and tools to
help them navigate their daily work. One such tool is OpenAI’s
Generative Pretrained Transformer <a
href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/interact.sh/%2f../">(GPT-3)</a>,
an artificial intelligence (AI) language model which interacts with
users in a conversational manner through its popular ChatGPT-3
interface. In this article, we will explore the usefulness of GPT-3 by
examining its performance in handling three common challenges that
developers may encounter in their work. These challenges include
generating new code, explaining unfamiliar code constructs, and
deciphering unusual error messages.</p>
<h2 id="use-case-1---generating-new-code">Use Case #1 - Generating new
code</h2>
<p>ChatGPT-3 can generate new code. This feature is widely covered in
the media and on OpenAI’s website itself, so let’s not dwell too long.
Here are some sample prompts and accompanying responses from
ChatGPT-3.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><u>Prompt</u></strong>: Create boilerplate code for a
React.js project<br />
<strong><u>Response</u></strong>: Here is some boilerplate code for a

<p>This code creates an App class that extends React.Component and has a
render method that returns JSX to be rendered to the page. The App
component is then rendered to the element with the root ID. You can add
your own state and JSX to customize the component.</p>
<hr />
<p>That looks acceptable. GPT-3 even explained the code in plain
English. The output can be corroborated by simply running the code and
confirming that it behaves as described.</p>
<p>A more challenging prompt is to solve Problem 2 from <a
href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=2">Project Euler</a>, which is a
series of problems that require mathematical and programming proficiency
to solve.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><u>Prompt</u></strong>: Solve Problem 2 from Project
Euler:</p>
<p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will
be:</p>
<p>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, …</p>
<p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do
not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>
<p><strong><u>Response</u></strong>: Here is a recursive solution to
Problem 2 in Project Euler using Python:</p>

<p>This function takes in three arguments: the maximum value (n), the
first term (a), and the second term (b) of the Fibonacci sequence. It
also has an optional argument sum that keeps track of the sum of the
even-valued terms in the sequence.</p>
<hr />
<p>The solution comes with comments and a brief explanation of how the
code works. The recursive function accepts one mandatory argument (the
maximum value <code>n</code>) and three optional arguments:<br />
- <code>a</code>: The first term of the sequence<br />
- <code>b</code>: The second term of the sequence<br />
- <code>sum</code>: The running sum of the even-valued terms</p>
<p>If <code>b</code> exceeds the maximum value specified, then the
entire sum is returned and the function completes. Otherwise, the
function checks if the second term is even and adds it to the running
sum, and the function is called again. However, ChatGPT-3 did not
correctly pick up on the fact that the last 3 arguments are optional, so
the solution description is not accurate in this instance.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s come up with some fun and novel code based on a vague
prompt, in a functional programming language called Standard ML:</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><u>Prompt</u></strong>: Write an interesting Standard ML
program based on <a href="https://www.bartleby.com/129/">Bartleby’s

<p><strong><u>Response</u></strong>: Here is a possible Standard ML

<p>This program defines a function <code>bartleby</code> that represents
the actions of the character Bartleby from the parable. The function has
a list of tasks that Bartleby is asked to do, and for each task Bartleby
responds with the message “I would prefer not to”. If Bartleby responds
with this message for all tasks, then the function prints that Bartleby
is uncooperative and does not complete any tasks. Otherwise, the
function prints that Bartleby completes some tasks, but not all.</p>
<hr />
<p>Impressively, ChatGPT-3 is able to generate a functional program
based on a couple of totally unrelated topics: recursive programming in
SML and the parable of <a
href="https://www.bartleby.com/129/">“Bartleby, the Scrivener”</a>. This
is a short story written by Herman Melville in 1853 about a Wall Street
clerk who refuses to do his boss’s bidding, simply replying “I would
prefer not to,”, a feeling shared by many programmers when the holidays
approach. The output is a short SML program that seems to produce a
variation of this response based on what is asked of him. However, there
are a few problems - both on the programming side as well as the story
side.</p>
<p>First of all, this code does not compile because the
<code>forall</code> function is not defined in this context. The fix is
to rewrite the <code>if(forall (...))</code> expression in a recursive
style.</p>
<p>Second, in the original parable, Bartleby refuses to complete any
task asked of him, yet this code indicates that he may complete some
tasks, but not all. It doesn’t make sense to include this branch in the
conditional statement based on the original story. This intersection of
unrelated topics seems to prove difficult for the language model to
process properly.</p>
<p>The code provided requires some intermediate familiarity with
Standard ML to debug and fix successfully. Therefore, in this example,
the programmer is not fully relieved from the task of writing idiomatic
and correct code. GPT-3 performs well with close-ended requests, such as
how to create simple code in a language. It seems to struggle with
open-ended requests that have an indefinite solution, such as the query
to write a program about Bartleby.</p>
<h2 id="use-case-2---explaining-unfamiliar-constructs">Use Case #2 -
Explaining unfamiliar constructs</h2>
<p>How does ChatGPT-3 handle unfamiliar syntax and programming
constructs? In the following example, a Complex number class is created
using a construct called an <a
href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operators">overloaded
operator</a>. This construct is not uncommon, but may be unfamiliar to
some developers. Let’s see if GPT-3 can make sense of this code.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><u>Prompt</u></strong>: What does this C++ code mean?</p>

<p><strong><u>Response</u></strong>: This C++ code defines a Complex
class that represents complex numbers. The Complex class has two member
variables, re and im, that represent the real and imaginary parts of the
complex number, respectively. It also has a constructor that takes the
real and imaginary parts as arguments and initializes the re and im
member variables.</p>
<p>The Complex class also has a operator+ member function that overloads
the + operator for the Complex class. This function takes another
Complex object as an argument and returns a new Complex object that is
the sum of the two operands. The operator+ function uses the re and im
member variables of the Complex objects to compute the sum of the two
complex numbers, and then it returns a new Complex object with the
result.</p>
<p>This Complex class allows you to create Complex objects and add them
using the + operator, as shown in the following example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre
class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">int</span> main<span class="op">()</span> <span class="op">{</span></span>

<span id="cb5-7"><a href="#cb5-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this example, we create two Complex objects a and b, and then add
them using the + operator. The result is a new Complex object c that
represents the sum of the two operands. Because we have overloaded the +
operator for the Complex class, the + operator will automatically call
the operator+ member function of the Complex class to add the two
objects and return the result.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is a good explanation of the Complex number class created. GPT-3
was able to understand that this code relates to complex numbers based
on the names of the class and member variables, even though the code was
uncommented. Finally, it was able to write an example of how to use the
Complex function to add two complex numbers using the overloaded +
operator. GPT-3 performs well when presented with a question about
language syntax, a well-documented concept that lends itself to
definitive answers.</p>
<h2 id="use-case-3---deciphering-arcane-error-messages">Use Case #3 -

<p>This code should compile successfully, yet generate a segfault to
out-of-bounds access of items in vector <code>v</code>. Yet when we run
<code>g++ segfault.cpp</code>, which uses <a
href="https://gcc.gnu.org">GNU Compiler</a> to compile the code to an
executable, the following error message is generated at compilation:</p>
<pre><code>segfault-example.cpp:5:20: error: expected &#39;;&#39; at end of declaration

1 error generated.</code></pre>
<p>Helpfully, the error explains where a semicolon needs to be inserted.
We could resolve the error by filling the vector on the next line, but
that isn’t an elegant solution, nor does it make sense. If we research
the <a
href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/vector">rules
of expression for vectors</a>, we discover that this syntax is correct,
as it uses an initializer list {1,2,3} to construct the vector.</p>
<p>Something doesn’t make sense. The syntax used is valid, so why are we
getting this error? Let’s revisit the link and carefully read again:</p>

<p>None of this is obvious, even to an experienced programmer. A C++
novice trying to understand syntax will find this frustrating to
debug.</p>
<p>Can GPT-3 save the day? Will it get distracted by the obvious
segfault issue? Or will it dig deeper and discover which g++ flag needs
to be used to compile to C++11 and allow the use of vector intializer
lists?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><u>Prompt</u></strong>: Why won’t this C++ code compile when
I run “g++ file.cpp”?</p>
<p><strong><u>Response</u></strong>: It looks like there is an issue
with the for loop in your code. The loop variable i is being initialized
to 1, and the loop is continuing as long as i is less than or equal to
4. This means that the loop will attempt to access the elements at
indices 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the vector v. However, the vector v only has 3
elements (at indices 0, 1, and 2), so attempting to access the element
at index 4 will result in an out-of-bounds error.</p>
<p>To fix this issue, you can modify the loop condition to stop the loop
before i becomes greater than the size of the vector. For example, you
could change the loop condition to i &lt; v.size() or i &lt; 3 (since
the vector has 3 elements).</p>
<hr />
<p>GPT-3 successfully discovered the run-time segfault that results from
accessing an out-of-bounds value, but it failed to explain that gcc is
not compiling to the correct version of C++. Let’s refine the prompt and
try again:</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><u>Prompt</u></strong>: The error received for the previous
code was:</p>
<pre><code>segfault-example.cpp:5:20: error: expected &#39;;&#39; at end of declaration
        std::vector&lt;int&gt; v{1,2,3};      
                          ^
                          ;
1 error generated.</code></pre>
<p><strong><u>Response</u></strong>: I apologize for the mistake in my
previous response. It looks like there is a different issue with your
code.</p>
<p>The error message expected ‘;’ at the end of declaration is
indicating that there is a problem with the line
<code>std::vector&lt;int&gt; v{1,2,3};</code>. This line is using list
initialization to create a new vector and initialize it with the
elements 1, 2, and 3. The curly braces {} are used to enclose the list
of elements, and a semicolon ; is used to terminate the statement. It
looks like there is a typo in this line of code, and the semicolon is
missing. To fix the error, add a semicolon ; after the closing curly
brace }: After adding the semicolon, the code should compile without any
issues.</p>
<hr />
<p>Politely, GPT-3 tries to fix the error. However, the response
misleads us into debugging the syntax once again, even after we provided
ample hints that the problem resides not with the code, but the
compiler. The correct solution is to compile the program with the
command <code>g++ -std=c++11 segfault.cpp</code> so that the compiler
uses the syntax rules of C++11 to generate the program with a vector
initializer list.</p>
<p>This example demonstrates that GPT-3 is capable of syntax debugging,
but falls short when the problem lies outside of syntax mistakes. As a
result, a programmer must still have a good idea of what the solution
space for a problem looks like and recognize when they are being led
astray.</p>
<h2 id="summary-and-implications">Summary and Implications</h2>
<p>AI tools like GitHub CoPilot and TabNine can be useful for
programmers, but they have also faced <a
href="https://matthewbutterick.com/chron/this-copilot-is-stupid-and-wants-to-kill-me.html">controversy</a>.
GPT-3 is unlikely to remain immune from similar questions about where
the code it is generating actually comes from. Therefore, programmers
should be cautious when relying on AI tools and approach results with a
grain of salt.</p>
<p>GPT-3 excels at processing close-ended, complete problems. These are
problems where the shape of the solution is evident in the distance and
slowly reveals itself in a progressive manner, like a distant island
that a castaway paddles towards during sunset. As long as they don’t
lose sight or give up, they’ll reach their target.</p>
<p>On the other hand, GPT-3 struggles with open-ended problems. These
problems have multiple viable solutions, but it is unclear which path to
pursue. These solutions are like distant stars to a spaceship - they all
look equally far apart and appear about the same size and shape - how
does the pilot decide which to navigate to? Each star requires a lot of
research just to determine its composition, yet the mere nature of a
star doesn’t provide any guarantees about what might be there once one
arrives.</p>

<p>Rather than fear automation in the field of software engineering,
programmers should embrace it as a way to improve productivity and stay
current with technological advances. Automation has been a part of the
software engineering industry from its inception - from Ada Lovelace’s
<a

of a language to run Charles Babbage’s analytical engine, to text
editors with macros, to GUI buttons that enable shortcuts for a series
of commands with the click of a button.</p>
<p>Imagine a future where a knowledge worker, on their first day of
work, is issued a badge, a personal computer, and an AI assistant
personalized to the knowledge and training they need to know for their
job. One could ask the assistant to summarize complex documentation or
get clarification on a process, among other use cases.</p>
<p>For programmers specifically, there are other ways that AI tools can
be folded into a workflow, such as <a

learning</a> from complex programming problems.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is up to the individual programmer to use AI tools
responsibly and effectively in their work. In this article, we explored
the strengths and weaknesses of GPT-3 in executing three tasks a
programmer encounters in their daily work - generating new code,
explaining existing code, and debugging code. The same precautions one
takes after consulting Google or StackOverflow for help with these tasks
should be taken when consulting an AI assistant as well. By following
best practices, such as not sharing proprietary software or information,
and approaching results with a critical eye, programmers can take
advantage of AI tools and enhance their productivity.</p>
<h1 id="misc-notes">MISC NOTES</h1>
<p>What do I mean by traditional sense of efficiency? Teh connotation
for me is blah blah blah work smart not hard blah but that phrase never
made sense to me for some reason. Efficiency has one meaning in physical
systems, but the mind and body is a physiological symbiosis (mind-body
??? Descartes?) blah blahAI doesn’t just automate away tasks. It can
alleviate mental burden. In the morning, you come across some bizarre
C++ syntax that you’ve never encountered while reviewing a colleague’s
code. You have a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask the colleague what the heck that syntax is. Perhaps they’re very
senior to you, and you’re still a bit timid about asking an uneducated
question. Alright let’s just put off the conversation for a bit, I’ll go
work on something else.</li>
<li>Damn! I gotta finish that review. Hmm…now it’s 11AM which is kinda
late for me to be asking such a basic question…alright I trust my
colleague, let’s just approve this and I can move on to the rest of my
day without worry.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might think, c’mon take more responsibility than that - that was
only 2 hours. But the fact of the matter is, these scenarios happen a
LOT among more junior colleagues. As a recent graduate from junior
colleague to just colleage, I am not too far removed from those feelings
myself. The feelings of inadequacy, of imposter syndrome. Of not knowing
if you’re in the right career, of maybe being seen as a fraud for any
number of reasons. For me it’s the fact that I don’t have any formal
computer science degrees. It eats at me a lot more than I care to admit
(he says, in a moment of rare personal vulnerability).</p>
<p>Here’s the weird syntax I saw recently that I’m talking about:</p>
<p>(go grab something weird CH did, change the variables, and post
here)</p>

<p>Wow! What is that??? [Once you see the code, share a few guesses then
give up]. What are the options now? Maybe it’s time to go learn about
each of these topics and see if any of them connect. If I had unlimited
time and this was a school project, I would love to do that. But I don’t
have the first and this isn’t the second. Another option is to schedule
a quick call or send a chat to DB. Hmmm…he’s busy right now, and
probably will be for a while. Don’t want to bug him…no one else on the
team would have more context than I do, so asking another colleague is
probably not productive. I’m running out of resources to ask now…ok what
do I THINK it is? Let me try each of these guesses/potential rabbit
holes. I will need an hour or two of uninterpreted time today to do
that. Darn, there’s a scrum meeting in 20 minutes, which is scheduled
for 15 minutes but will take more like 30. I have a 1:1 at noon and I
have to prepare for that, so I don’t want to get too far down the rabbit
hole and then forget. So let’s save this for after lunch…shoot maybe
2PM, I told someone I would help them out with something around 1. Okay
2-4PM works! But by the time I get out of my rabbit hole, it might be
getting too late to contact the author and explain that I was too busy
all day to ask a question.</p>
<p>Does this spiral make any sense? I hope so, because I’m weighing
these kinds of ridiculous calculations in my head. I know, I know - get
better at your job so you’re brave enough to just ask a question.</p>
<p>In my opinion, next to knowing when to ask for help, a skill of a
great programmer is the ability to be highly resourceful. When facing
certain problems, we want every debugging tool, every StackOverflow
entry, every man page written since 1969, and (one more). The next
“,and” should be a custom-trained AI. An AI personalized to the
knowledge YOU need to know.</p>
<p>(Okay right there - that is a GREAT business idea. And it comes from
DIRECT, PERSONAL experience. So I know EXACTLY what I want it to do. I
believe it will be extremely useful to anyone who can realize it’s
value. I think the people who can will be those who see the future. This
IS the future right here. I can see it, and I think others can, but I
don’t know where they are or how to find them. - well, those ppl are in
AI - right?)</p>
<p>I started using GPT-3 to answer these kinds of tiny questions,
redacted of any sensitive information, starting in early December. It
had been maybe a week since I had vaguely heard of this new AI model in
the news. Somehow, I got interested in it on a whim and decided to see
if there was an API I could play with. Even better, a fully fledged
chatbot! From there, I tried out a few simple questions that rapidly
grew in complexity, until I was quite literally astounded by what I was
looking at. I don’t feel like that happens very often in my life
anymore, which was also shocking to me that a piece of technology could
have this level of impact on me. I could see vastly capable futures
spawning in front of me for the first time, directly as a result of this
AI technology I was seeing here. In the current information age (is that
what we’re currently in?), if knowledge workers can vastly improving
their efficiency by making information more easily accessible, that’s as
big as what the Internet meant when it first became public. There are
likely entire industries in AI that have yet to be uncovered.</p>
<p>What is the idea there? It’s that you offer a service that improves a
software engineers ability to get answers. You ask them for as many
details about their work life as you can. The more details the better.
The problem is, no one will trust their sensitive company data to a
freaking AI.</p>
<p>What if it just connects to github? A lot of people host public code
on github. It could be run on open-source packages. I think it already
does, doesn’t it? What is Github Copilot?</p>

<h2 id="original-introduction">Original Introduction</h2>
<p><strong><u>Prompt</u></strong>: Write an introductory paragraph about
how to use GPT3 in your day-to-day work as a software engineer.<br />
<strong><u>Response</u></strong>: <em>As a software engineer, you’re
constantly working on complex projects and dealing with a vast amount of
information. GPT-3, the state-of-the-art language processing model from
OpenAI, can help you manage your workload and make your daily work more
efficient. In this article, we’ll show you how to use GPT-3 to improve
your productivity as a software engineer. We’ll provide tips on
integrating GPT-3 into your development process, using it to generate

troubleshoot your code. With GPT-3, you can easily access the
information you need, quickly generate high-quality code and
documentation, and stay on top of your tasks, all while saving time and
reducing stress.</em></p>
<p>Across 4 prompts, I slowly refined the request I had of GPT-3. I
wanted an introduction, yes, but I needed a few other intangibles and I
vaguely ventured towards a decent introduction that I liked by the end
of the refinement process. GPT-3 clearly has some value with helping me
write pseudo-technical articles, such as this one. But can it help me
with day-to-day programming tasks? To answer that question, I replaced
my typical Google/Stack Overflow querying process (find a better phrase)
with simply asking Chat GPT-3 what was on my mind (reword). The results
convinced me that AI of this type has as important a role in knowledge
discovery as Internet forums and Google do currently (ugh rough thesis,
refine it).</p>
<h2 id="caveat">Caveat</h2>
<p>I am a software engineer, but I do not work in AI or keep up enough
to know what is cutting edge (reword). So if I’m seeing things
incorrectly, or editorializing too much and not speaking factually, then
I do apologize. But I also wanted to share the emotional aspect of why
GPT-3 seems so significant to me.</p>
<p><strong><u>Prompt</u></strong>: Can you rephrase the previous
paragraph to sound less awkward<br />
<strong><u>Response</u></strong>: <em>As a software engineer, I am not
well-versed in the latest developments in AI. If I have misstated any
facts or come across as awkward in my writing, I apologize. However, I
wanted to share my personal excitement about GPT-3 and why it feels like
a significant milestone.</em></p>
<p><strong><u>Prompt</u></strong>: I don’t really like that response,
can you try again?<br />
<strong><u>Response</u></strong>: *Sure, here is another attempt at
rephrasing the paragraph:</p>
<p>As a software engineer, I am not an expert in the field of AI and may
not be aware of the latest advancements. If my lack of knowledge leads
to any inaccuracies in my writing, I apologize. I wanted to share my
personal thoughts and feelings about GPT-3 and why it feels like an
important achievement.*</p>
<p>Much better. That whole process of coming up with a satisfactory
introductory paragraph took about an hour from start to finish. I
tweaked the original output from Chat GPT-3 so that it sounds more like
my voice. So let’s start over. The beginning of the article starts…now:
<strong><u>Prompt</u></strong> 1: Write an introductory paragraph to an

<h2 id="implications-attempt-1">Implications (Attempt 1)</h2>
<p>What does it mean when the answers to a lot of minute, but difficult
programming questions are at our fingerprints? Does it lower the bar for
programmers across the board? Can anyone just generate code, rendering
software engineering as a field obsolete? Conversely, is it dangerous to
rely on AI tools like this at all, because it might render us all weaker
problem-solvers in general? [I hate this sentence. It is a wild example
of me generating a fake middle ground and resolving it. This is a cheesy
rhetorical tactic, and it’s also just a middle ground fallacy.] Like
most things, the answer probably lies in the middle. Certainly there are
still many aspects to software engineering that can’t be answered by an
online AI - such as who are the customers, what are their needs, and
what are their real timelines. But it’s also unproductive to dismiss AI
entirely, just as it would have been to dismiss Internet search engines
and forums in the 1990s.</p>
