<p>How to use chat gpt3 to supercharge your software career “” “”
Enhance your career as a knowledge worker</p>
<p>Getting feedback on this article: - My goal with this article is to
explore a deep dive of using Chat GPT3 for some genuinely unique and
difficult programming questions. The audience is other software
engineers, and I want to satisfy that need to dig deeper and learn more
in these articles. They often felt written at too high of a level and
try to cater to too broad of an audience. The audience for this article
might be small, but I think they will appreciate and respect us more as
a company for writing long-form technical articles like this. - Ask
people, “I wanted to write an article about this new AI engine that I
think is really revolutionary, but I also editorialized quite a bit than
I normally do when I’m writing stuff up, so I was wondering if you can
read this and tell me if there’s something good about it, or I just
sound kind of full of myself because I don’t work in the AI field and it
clearly shows. - Do I just have to post this to DEPT’s blog? What if
other sites want to carry this article too? Ask Kelsey what happens,
don’t want to sound arrogant but just curious what the rules are if I
wanted to cross-post this article to another site, or if another site
approached to me.</p>
<p>Make some predicitons</p>
<p>Interfacing successfully with an AI will become a skill just like it
is to use Google.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop a good bs sensor</p></li>
<li><p>Ask probing questions like you would of a human you don’t
trust</p></li>
<li><p>Periodically ask sanity-check questions that you know the answer
to</p></li>
<li><p>Treat it like a senior colleague who you are trying to ask a
carefully crafted question. It should be an open-ended question,
good-natured in demeanor, and not be leading.</p></li>
<li><p>Use it for as many things as you can. See what kinds of questions
it can and can’t answer properly, and tune your future questions to what
it seems to answer best. (don’t like that sentence a whole lot)</p></li>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Programmers frequently work on complex projects and handle a vast
amount of information - whether that be:<br />
- multiple IDE’s worth of key bindings<br />
- context shifting between high-level code, back-end scripting, and
assembly code<br />
- arcane discrete math operations</p>
<p>…and other obscure intellectual gymnastics. As a programmer advances
in their career, it is important for them to develop strategies to
manage this cognitive load. OpenAI’s Generative Pretrained Transformer,
or <a
href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/interact.sh/%2f../">ChatGPT-3</a>,
is an implementation of a trained language model which interacts with
participants in a conversational manner. GPT-3 can help manage
information overload and make daily work more efficient. In this
article, we will explore the performance of GPT-3 in handling common
hurdles a programmer encounters in their daily work.</p>
<h2 id="use-case-1---generating-new-code">Use Case #1 - Generating new

<p>ChatGPT-3 can generate new code. This feature is widely covered in
the media and on OpenAI’s website itself, so let’s not dwell too
long:</p>

<p>That looks decent. ChatGPT-3 even explained the code in plain
English. It is easy to corroborate the output by simply running the code
and checking that it behaves as described.</p>
<p>Here is something more challenging. Problem 2 from <a
href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=2">Project Euler</a> is as
follows:</p>
<p>Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers</p>
<p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will
be:</p>
<p>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, …</p>
<p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do
not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>
<p>Let’s ask ChatGPT-3 to solve this problem for us:</p>
<p>Prompt: Solve Problem 2 from Project Euler.<br />
Response: Here is a recursive solution to Problem 2 in Project Euler
using Python:</p>

<p><em>This function takes in three arguments: the maximum value (n),
the first term (a), and the second term (b) of the Fibonacci sequence.
It also has an optional argument sum that keeps track of the sum of the
even-valued terms in the sequence</em>.</p>
<p>The solution offered by ChatGPT-3 comes with comments and a brief
explanation of how the code works. The recursive function accepts 1
mandatory argument (the maximum value <code>n</code>), and three
optional arguments: - The first term of the sequence <code>a</code> -
The second term of the sequence <code>b</code> - The running sum of the
even-valued terms <code>sum</code></p>
<p>If <code>b</code> exceeds the maximum value specified, then the
entire sum is returned and the function completes. Otherwise, the
function checks if the second term is even and adds it to the running
sum, and the function is called again.</p>
<p>ChatGPT-3 did not correctly pick up on the fact that the last 3
arguments are optional however, so the solution description is not
accurate in this instance.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s come up with some fun, novel, and slightly indulgent
code based on a vague prompt, in a functional programming language
called Standard ML:</p>
<p>Prompt:
<code>Write an interesting Standard ML program based on Bartleby's Parable</code><br />

<em>Here is a possible Standard ML program that is based on Bartleby’s

<p><em>This program defines a function bartleby that represents the
actions of the character Bartleby from the parable. The function has a
list of tasks that Bartleby is asked to do, and for each task Bartleby
responds with the message “I would prefer not to”. If Bartleby responds
with this message for all tasks, then the function prints that Bartleby
is uncooperative and does not complete any tasks. Otherwise, the
function prints that Bartleby completes some tasks, but not
all.</em></p>
<p>Impressively, ChatGPT-3 is able to generate a functional program
based on a couple of totally unrelated topics: recursive programming in
SML, and the parable of “Bartleby, the Scrivener”. This is a short story
written by Herman Melville in 1853 about a Wall Street clerk who refuses
to do his boss’s bidding, simply replying “I would prefer not to,”, a
feeling shared by many of us when the holidays approach. The output is a
short SML program that seems to produce a variation of this response
based on what is asked of him. However, there are a few problems - both
on the programming side as well as the story side.</p>
<p>First of all, this code does not compile because the
<code>forall</code> function is not defined in this context. The fix is
to rewrite the <code>if(forall (...))</code> expression in a recursive
style.</p>
<p>Second, in the original parable, Bartleby refuses to complete any
task asked of him, yet this code indicates that he may complete some
tasks, but not all. It doesn’t make sense to add this branch to the case
statement based on the original story. This intersection of unrelated
topics seems to prove difficult for the language model to process
properly.</p>
<p>The code provided requires some intermediate familiarity with
Standard ML to debug and fix successfully. Therefore in this example,
the programmer is not fully relieved from the task of writing idiomatic
and correct code. With some further refinement to the prompt, it is
possible that ChatGPT-3 could answer this question more effectively.</p>
<h2 id="use-case-2---explaining-unfamiliar-constructs">Use Case #2 -

<p>Response: <em>This C++ code defines a Complex class that represents

<p><em>In this example, we create two Complex objects a and b, and then
add them using the + operator. The result is a new Complex object c that
represents the sum of the two operands. Because we have overloaded the +
operator for the Complex class, the + operator will automatically call
the operator+ member function of the Complex class to add the two
objects and return the result.</em></p>
<p>This is a very good explanation of the Complex number class created.
GPT-3 was able to understand that this code relates to complex numbers
based on the names of the class and member variables, even though the
code was uncommented. Finally, it was able to write an example of how to
use the Complex function to add two complex numbers using the overloaded
+ operator. Disclaimer: Data inputted into ChatGPT-3 is NOT treated as

that isn’t an elegant solution. The normal workflow for a programmer is
to research the rules of expression for vectors in our <a
href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/vector">favorite
C++ reference</a> and discover that this syntax is correct, as it uses
an initializer list {1,2,3} to construct the vector.</p>
<p>Something doesn’t make sense. The syntax used is valid, so why are we
getting this error? Let’s revisit the link and carefully read again:</p>
<p>[screenshot of implementation option 10), along with screenshot of
code example near bottom]</p>
<p>The initializer list syntax for vectors was not implemented until
C++11! By default, the version of <code>g++</code> on my machine
compiles to C++97 by default:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">❯</span> g++ <span class="at">--version</span> <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="fu">head</span> <span class="at">-1</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">Apple</span> clang version 13.1.6 <span class="er">(</span><span class="ex">clang-1316.0.21.2</span><span class="kw">)</span></span>

<span id="cb8-4"><a href="#cb8-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#define __cplusplus 199711L</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>None of this is obvious. A C++ novice trying to understand syntax
will find this frustrating to debug. Can GPT-3 save the day? Will it get
distracted by the obvious segfault issue? Or will it dig deeper and
discover which g++ flag needs to be used to compile to C++11 and allow
the use of vector intializer lists?</p>
<p>Prompt:
<code>Why won't this C++ code compile when I run "g++ file.cpp"?</code>
Response:</p>
<p><em>It looks like there is an issue with the for loop in your code.
The loop variable i is being initialized to 1, and the loop is
continuing as long as i is less than or equal to 4. This means that the
loop will attempt to access the elements at indices 1, 2, 3, and 4 of
the vector v. However, the vector v only has 3 elements (at indices 0,
1, and 2), so attempting to access the element at index 4 will result in
an out-of-bounds error.</em></p>
<p><em>To fix this issue, you can modify the loop condition to stop the
loop before i becomes greater than the size of the vector. For example,
you could change the loop condition to i &lt; v.size() or i &lt; 3
(since the vector has 3 elements).</em></p>
<p>GPT-3 successfully discovered the run-time segfault that results from
accessing an out-of-bounds value, but it failed to explain that gcc is
not compiling to the correct version of C++. Let’s refine the prompt and
try again:</p>
<p>Prompt:
<code>The error received for the previous code was:</code></p>
<pre><code>segfault-example.cpp:5:20: error: expected &#39;;&#39; at end of declaration
        std::vector&lt;int&gt; v{1,2,3};      
                          ^
                          ;
1 error generated.</code></pre>
<p>Response:<br />
<em>I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. It looks like
there is a different issue with your code.</em></p>
<p><em>The error message expected ‘;’ at end of declaration is
indicating that there is a problem with the line
<code>std::vector&lt;int&gt; v{1,2,3};</code>. This line is using list
initialization to create a new vector and initialize it with the
elements 1, 2, and 3. The curly braces {} are used to enclose the list
of elements, and a semicolon ; is used to terminate the statement. It
looks like there is a typo in this line of code, and the semicolon is
missing. To fix the error, add a semicolon ; after the closing curly
brace }: After adding the semicolon, the code should compile without any
issues.</em></p>
<p>Politely, GPT-3 tries again to fix the error. However, the response
misleads us into debugging the syntax once again, even after we provided
ample hints that the problem resides not with the code, but the
compiler. The correct solution is to compile the program with the
command <code>g++ -std=c++11 segfault.cpp</code> so that the compiler
uses the syntax rules of C++11 to generate the program.</p>
<p>This example demonstrates that GPT-3 is capable of syntax debugging,
but falls short when the problem lies outside of syntax mistakes. As a
result, a programmer must still have a good idea of what the solution
space for a problem looks like and recognize when they are being led
astray.</p>
<h2 id="summary-and-implications">Summary and Implications</h2>
<p>AI tools like GitHub CoPilot and TabNine can be useful for
programmers, but they have also faced
(controversy)[https://matthewbutterick.com/chron/this-copilot-is-stupid-and-wants-to-kill-me.html].
GPT-3 is unlikely to remain immune from similar questions about fair
usage. Therefore, programmers should be cautious when relying on AI
tools and approach results with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>GPT-3 excels at processing close-ended, complete problems. These are
problems where the shape of the solution is evident in the distance and
slowly reveals itself in a progressive manner, like a distant island
that an ocean castaway paddles towards. As long as they don’t lose sight
or give up, they’ll reach their target.</p>
<p>On the other hand, GPT-3 struggles with open-ended problems. These
problems have multiple viable solutions, but it is unclear which path to
pursue. These solutions are like distant stars to a spaceship - they all
look equally far apart and appear about the same size and shape - how
does the pilot decide where to fly? Each star requires a lot of research
just to determine it’s composition, yet that doesn’t provide any
guarantees about what might be there once one arrives.</p>
<p>(use images in /assets/chat-gpt) (Prompt 1: Shiprecked guy who looks
like a Flintstone is slowly paddling to a distant island with the sun
setting in the distance)<br />

(Generate both images with Dall-E, put footnote at very end of article.
That will make the reward of reading the footnote feel exciting)</p>
<p>Rather than fear automation in the field of software engineering,
programmers should embrace it as a way to improve productivity and stay
current with technological advances. Automation has been a part of the
software engineering industry all the way to to it’s inception - from
Ada Lovelace’s <a
href="https://books.google.com/books?id=hPRmnQEACAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">description</a>
of a language to run Charles Babbage’s analytical engine, to text
editors with macros, to GUI buttons that enable shortcuts for series of
commands with the click of a button.</p>
<p>The history of technology is the history of automation. This is
evident in other industries as well, such as the transition from <a
href="https://youtu.be/YpWdOBwpLuE?t=323">crank lever</a> to [starter
motors]
(https://www.howacarworks.com/basics/how-the-starting-system-work) and
ignition keys for automobiles.</p>
<p>Imagine a future where a knowledge worker, on their first day of
work, is issued a badge, a personal computer, and an AI assistant
personalized to the knowledge and training they need to know for their
job. One could ask the assistant to summarize complex documentation or
get clarification on a process, among other use cases.</p>
<p>For programmers specifically, there are other ways that AI tools can
be folded into a workflow, such as <a
href="https://books.google.com/books?id=hPRmnQEACAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">facilitating
undirected learning</a>, improving <a

management</a>, and <a

learning</a> from complex programming problems.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it’s up to the individual programmer to use AI tools
responsibly and effectively in their work. By following best practices,
such as not sharing proprietary software or information, and approaching
results with a critical eye, programmers can take advantage of AI tools
while minimizing the potential risks.</p>
<h1 id="misc-notes">MISC NOTES</h1>
<p>What do I mean by traditional sense of efficiency? Teh connotation
for me is blah blah blah work smart not hard blah but that phrase never
made sense to me for some reason. Efficiency has one meaning in physical
systems, but the mind and body is a physiological symbiosis (mind-body
??? Descartes?) blah blahAI doesn’t just automate away tasks. It can
alleviate mental burden. In the morning, you come across some bizarre
C++ syntax that you’ve never encountered while reviewing a colleague’s
code. You have a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask the colleague what the heck that syntax is. Perhaps they’re very
senior to you, and you’re still a bit timid about asking an uneducated
question. Alright let’s just put off the conversation for a bit, I’ll go
work on something else.</li>
<li>Damn! I gotta finish that review. Hmm…now it’s 11AM which is kinda
late for me to be asking such a basic question…alright I trust my
colleague, let’s just approve this and I can move on to the rest of my
day without worry.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might think, c’mon take more responsibility than that - that was
only 2 hours. But the fact of the matter is, these scenarios happen a
LOT among more junior colleagues. As a recent graduate from junior
colleague to just colleage, I am not too far removed from those feelings
myself. The feelings of inadequacy, of imposter syndrome. Of not knowing
if you’re in the right career, of maybe being seen as a fraud for any
number of reasons. For me it’s the fact that I don’t have any formal
computer science degrees. It eats at me a lot more than I care to admit
(he says, in a moment of rare personal vulnerability).</p>
<p>Here’s the weird syntax I saw recently that I’m talking about:</p>
<p>(go grab something weird CH did, change the variables, and post
here)</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre
class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&lt;</span>code goes here<span class="op">&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Wow! What is that??? [Once you see the code, share a few guesses then
give up]. What are the options now? Maybe it’s time to go learn about
each of these topics and see if any of them connect. If I had unlimited
time and this was a school project, I would love to do that. But I don’t
have the first and this isn’t the second. Another option is to schedule
a quick call or send a chat to DB. Hmmm…he’s busy right now, and
probably will be for a while. Don’t want to bug him…no one else on the
team would have more context than I do, so asking another colleague is
probably not productive. I’m running out of resources to ask now…ok what
do I THINK it is? Let me try each of these guesses/potential rabbit
holes. I will need an hour or two of uninterpreted time today to do
that. Darn, there’s a scrum meeting in 20 minutes, which is scheduled
for 15 minutes but will take more like 30. I have a 1:1 at noon and I
have to prepare for that, so I don’t want to get too far down the rabbit
hole and then forget. So let’s save this for after lunch…shoot maybe
2PM, I told someone I would help them out with something around 1. Okay
2-4PM works! But by the time I get out of my rabbit hole, it might be
getting too late to contact the author and explain that I was too busy
all day to ask a question.</p>
<p>Does this spiral make any sense? I hope so, because I’m weighing
these kinds of ridiculous calculations in my head. I know, I know - get
better at your job so you’re brave enough to just ask a question.</p>
<p>In my opinion, next to knowing when to ask for help, a skill of a
great programmer is the ability to be highly resourceful. When facing
certain problems, we want every debugging tool, every StackOverflow
entry, every man page written since 1969, and (one more). The next
“,and” should be a custom-trained AI. An AI personalized to the
knowledge YOU need to know.</p>
<p>(Okay right there - that is a GREAT business idea. And it comes from
DIRECT, PERSONAL experience. So I know EXACTLY what I want it to do. I
believe it will be extremely useful to anyone who can realize it’s
value. I think the people who can will be those who see the future. This
IS the future right here. I can see it, and I think others can, but I
don’t know where they are or how to find them. - well, those ppl are in
AI - right?)</p>
<p>I started using GPT-3 to answer these kinds of tiny questions,
redacted of any sensitive information, starting in early December. It
had been maybe a week since I had vaguely heard of this new AI model in
the news. Somehow, I got interested in it on a whim and decided to see
if there was an API I could play with. Even better, a fully fledged
chatbot! From there, I tried out a few simple questions that rapidly
grew in complexity, until I was quite literally astounded by what I was
looking at. I don’t feel like that happens very often in my life
anymore, which was also shocking to me that a piece of technology could
have this level of impact on me. I could see vastly capable futures
spawning in front of me for the first time, directly as a result of this
AI technology I was seeing here. In the current information age (is that
what we’re currently in?), if knowledge workers can vastly improving
their efficiency by making information more easily accessible, that’s as
big as what the Internet meant when it first became public. There are
likely entire industries in AI that have yet to be uncovered.</p>
<p>What is the idea there? It’s that you offer a service that improves a
software engineers ability to get answers. You ask them for as many
details about their work life as you can. The more details the better.
The problem is, no one will trust their sensitive company data to a
freaking AI.</p>
<p>What if it just connects to github? A lot of people host public code
on github. It could be run on open-source packages. I think it already
does, doesn’t it? What is Github Copilot?</p>

<h2 id="original-introduction">Original Introduction</h2>
<p>Prompt: Write an introductory paragraph about how to use GPT3 in your
day-to-day work as a software engineer.<br />
Response: <em>As a software engineer, you’re constantly working on
complex projects and dealing with a vast amount of information. GPT-3,
the state-of-the-art language processing model from OpenAI, can help you
manage your workload and make your daily work more efficient. In this
article, we’ll show you how to use GPT-3 to improve your productivity as
a software engineer. We’ll provide tips on integrating GPT-3 into your
development process, using it to generate code and documentation, and
even using it to help you debug and troubleshoot your code. With GPT-3,
you can easily access the information you need, quickly generate
high-quality code and documentation, and stay on top of your tasks, all
while saving time and reducing stress.</em></p>
<p>Across 4 prompts, I slowly refined the request I had of GPT-3. I
wanted an introduction, yes, but I needed a few other intangibles and I
vaguely ventured towards a decent introduction that I liked by the end
of the refinement process. GPT-3 clearly has some value with helping me
write pseudo-technical articles, such as this one. But can it help me
with day-to-day programming tasks? To answer that question, I replaced
my typical Google/Stack Overflow querying process (find a better phrase)
with simply asking Chat GPT-3 what was on my mind (reword). The results
convinced me that AI of this type has as important a role in knowledge
discovery as Internet forums and Google do currently (ugh rough thesis,
refine it).</p>
<h2 id="caveat">Caveat</h2>
<p>I am a software engineer, but I do not work in AI or keep up enough
to know what is cutting edge (reword). So if I’m seeing things
incorrectly, or editorializing too much and not speaking factually, then
I do apologize. But I also wanted to share the emotional aspect of why
GPT-3 seems so significant to me.</p>
<p>Prompt: Can you rephrase the previous paragraph to sound less
awkward<br />
Response: <em>As a software engineer, I am not well-versed in the latest
developments in AI. If I have misstated any facts or come across as
awkward in my writing, I apologize. However, I wanted to share my
personal excitement about GPT-3 and why it feels like a significant
milestone.</em></p>
<p>Prompt: I don’t really like that response, can you try again?<br />
Response: *Sure, here is another attempt at rephrasing the
paragraph:</p>
<p>As a software engineer, I am not an expert in the field of AI and may
not be aware of the latest advancements. If my lack of knowledge leads
to any inaccuracies in my writing, I apologize. I wanted to share my
personal thoughts and feelings about GPT-3 and why it feels like an
important achievement.*</p>
<p>Much better. That whole process of coming up with a satisfactory
introductory paragraph took about an hour from start to finish. I
tweaked the original output from Chat GPT-3 so that it sounds more like
my voice. So let’s start over. The beginning of the article starts…now:
Prompt 1: Write an introductory paragraph to an article about how to use

<h2 id="implications-attempt-1">Implications (Attempt 1)</h2>
<p>What does it mean when the answers to a lot of minute, but difficult
programming questions are at our fingerprints? Does it lower the bar for
programmers across the board? Can anyone just generate code, rendering
software engineering as a field obsolete? Conversely, is it dangerous to
rely on AI tools like this at all, because it might render us all weaker
problem-solvers in general? [I hate this sentence. It is a wild example
of me generating a fake middle ground and resolving it. This is a cheesy
rhetorical tactic, and it’s also just a middle ground fallacy.] Like
most things, the answer probably lies in the middle. Certainly there are
still many aspects to software engineering that can’t be answered by an
online AI - such as who are the customers, what are their needs, and
what are their real timelines. But it’s also unproductive to dismiss AI
entirely, just as it would have been to dismiss Internet search engines
and forums in the 1990s.</p>
