## Introduction

If you haven't had to work in a regulated environment before, then you may not have ever worked with documents such as FMEAs, FTAs, or PRAs before. But behind a very boring veneer lies some extremely valuable tools that could greatly benefit the approach taken to software projects at large, not just in regulated environments.

I know what you guys are thinking, risk management??? Seriously? You might see phrases like dFMEA, pFMEA, uFMEA, PRA, requirements traceability and think - risk management is a bit of a snoozer of a topic. Don't worry, I'm going to do my best to avoid boring you with any of these acronyms, with exception of the FMEA, which is the only thing we'll focus on today.

So what _is_ an FMEA? It stands for **Failure Modes and Effects Analysis**. Before we start diving into the FMEA though, let's set up a little background information.

## Background

In the broader discipline of engineering, a failure can be defined as an unintended consequence in a manufactured item. The manifestation of a failure in software development is commonly known as a bug.

To formalize the definition of a bug, I'll define it as:
_Unexpected behavior in a deployed application as a result of code that does not adequately cover all possible field use conditions_

That's a mouthful. The informal, day-to-day definition can be stated as just:

_Code that doesn't behave the way it was designed_

Some bugs are immediately obvious and can be fixed in the moment. Others are latent, and only manifest themselves in the field or in a production environment. It is commonly stated that the cost of fixing a bug grows exponentially from the time it is created all the way to field deployment [*by who? go dig up those old DRM training slides, embed a chart would be nice here*]. This means the cost to fix a bug in code as soon as you write the code is very minimal. This is compared to noticing it when the code base is more mature, core engineers have left the project, and eventually the product is deployed to the field and might require a recall. Depending on the software, you might be able to deploy an over-the-air patch, but in critical embedded systems this may not be an option.

## "Just eliminate risk!"

This is extremely concerning to most managers. If you hang around management long enough, you might start to hear phrases like:

- _By attaining 100% test coverage, we will eliminate risk from this project._

- _When we can guarantee 99.9999% uptime, we can safely assume that failure will never happen._

And my personal favorite:

- _Just eliminate risk!_

Of course, with a statement like this - context matters. The gold standard in highly regulated industries is 6 nines - or 99.9999% reliability ([link to some DFSS resource]). However, in a system that has an opportunity to fail once a minute, math states that the system will eventually experience a failure after only 4 years (triple check this math!)

**It is a logical fallacy to state that risk can be eliminated.** Unless you are working in first principles where **MAYBE** you can get away with certain guarantees, then you cannot and should not guarantee that your product, whether that be software or hardware, will never fail. The likelihood of failure might range from common to astronomically rare, but it always exists. For this article,e I've left the definition of failure rather broad, and we'll find out in another article that there are failures with a range of effects, from minimal to catastrophic.

**The goal of risk management is to minimize risk in a technical project by minimizing the probability of failure and minimizing the impact of failure.**

## How?

How can we go about minimizing risk effectively? There are a number of tools out there, books written about the subject, and an entire risk management consulting industry dedicated to aerospace, medical device, and pharmaceutical risk management. One of the core tools used by every company in these industries is called the FMEA.

## The FMEA

The Failure Modes and Effects Analysis, or FMEA, tells you how failures at a component level propagate to system failures. This document can get massively complex for large system with many subsystems and components, such as an airplane. So what's the motivation? Why are we going to all this effort to analyze a manufactured product from a risk perspective? The goal of the FMEA is to tell a good story, and it does so in two key ways:

- The FMEA tells a top-down story to regulatory bodies
- The FMEA allows engineers to tell a bottom-up story

When a regulated device fails, the manufacturer has to explain to the regulatory body WHY it failed, and how they will fix it in the future. This is the top-down story. The FDA and FAA are examples of regulated bodies. All they know is that your device failed at the user level, and it's up to the manufacturer to guide them into the details of your device to identify the root cause of the failure, and ultimately fix it.

If a manufacturer is unable to provide a resolution, the device can be pulled from the market, either voluntarily by the manufacturer or as mandated by a regulatory body. A recent high-profile instance of this was the Boeing 737 MAX, which experienced a software failure in a program called MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) and ultimately caused 2 fatal accidents <sup>[r](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneuvering_Characteristics_Augmentation_System)</sup>.

## An Example

[insert image]

Airplanes and medical devices can be very complicated systems, so let's use an example everyone is familiar with - a bicycle. Let's pretend that DEPT is feeling particularly entrepreneurial and wants to get into the road bike space. Our task as engineers is to build a bicycle that is fast and safe. After all, if we want to sell our bike, we need to both convince customers that it's fast enough to win races, and safe enough to meet the minimum requirements imposed by the FBA (Federal Bicycle Administration), an entity that I just made up that allows manufacturers to sell bicycles in the United States.

The first step is to define the system architecture. Let's call this grouping of top-level entities Components. These are sometimes referred to as Items or Subsystems, so if you hear me say one of those terms, know that it’s the same thing as a component.

On our bicycle I’ll keep things simple and only analyze the Drivetrain, Brakes, and Frame [change to appropriate colors] for this example. Of course there are many other subsystems we could define and analyze as well, and we could even slice and dice the bike in a different way depending on the goals of our analysis. But for today we’ll just keep things simple. 

Some important questions to answer include:
What is the boundary of analysis for each component? This means, what sub-components of the bicycle are members of the drivetrain, which are components of the brake, and which are components of the frame? 
What are the functions of each component? What are some primary and secondary purposes of the drivetrain, the brakes, and the frame? So let’s get into that next
