# Environmentalism
November 23, 2022

OG environmentalism is really all you need, and it's a lot simpler to wrap your head around than modern environmentalism. Before environmentalism had anything to gain from money, all it really was about was treating our environment with kindness. It really just boiled down to respect for the universe. It was about reducing consumption and treating all people, animals, and living beings with kindness. All you had to do was ask yourself the question, "Is what I'm doing respectful to the universe?", and 9 times out of 10 you would arrive at the right answer.

Hinduism is a lot of things, but to me it's really just about that - treating the universe with kindness. Everything you interact with, including your body, is part of this universe that the soul gets to partake in. 

I recently began purging my life of all unnatural ingredients and products. I am striving to own only biodegradable products, because that means they are of natural processes, and will interact with my body in a positive manner. I am starting with only products that I ingest or touch, such as food or clothing. 

For food, I will only be consuming ingredients that I understand and agree with. For clothing, I am looking for natural fibers, such as cotton, linen, andwool. I also changed out my laundry detergents and lotions, because I realize those also interact with my skin significantly and must be as pure as possible while still serving its function. 

It's not easy, and it's not cheap to figure all this out. But it's a worthwhile endeavor that makes me feel good about the future.
