# Decentralized Volunteerism
August 2022

Right now, we have like 20 people trying to solve ALL the problems in the world. That is completely stupid. If those 20 people spent their entire waking existence trying to solve even one of the world's problems, they would never even be able to make a scratch in the surface. And we'd still have those other 19 problems to contend with.

We need everyone to do a little, collectively. If everyone spent like, 2 hours a YEAR helping with the world's problems, we'd solve ALL of them in like 6 months tops. I guarantee it.

If I were younger, the tone of this writing would start turning towards a question, like "Now how can we build a system that encourages that? Well of course with a fancy piece of technology that will get everyone piping hot to volunteer!" Alas, that optimism of my youth has faded as I enter my 30s. Wow. That's a sentence I never thought I'd utter.

I'm ensnared by the concerns of practicality. HOW do you get almost 8 billion people to do ANYTHING in a coordinated matter? What would they even do for those 2 hours? Is that 2 hours consecutive, or split up in 10 minutes a month, or maybe 20 seconds a day?

-> Well hang on, that's an interesting though. 2 hours is a long time, but 20 seconds every day is not. There are activities that EVERYONE does for at least 20 seconds a day.

For most of human history, these common activities were probably just biological activities. Then eventually they became some sort of hybrid of personal-societal benefits, like practicing good hygiene. Even that one's hit or miss but we aren't really working on that problem anymore, because it's generally considered solved in the parts of the world we care about.

I suspect that in the last 20 years certain personal-technical activities have crept into the mix. Checking your e-mail might have been the first mass technical addiction we all had. I guess there was also watching TV, or listening to the radio before that. But I really have no concept of how addicting "listening to the radio" might have ever been. I suspect it never was.

Even TV lacked that "always on" component until the 80s when I believe continuous programming likely began.

So back to the original problem, which I think I know the solution to now. It's addiction. You get people addicted to whatever it is you want to do, and then it just spreads naturally, like a virus. I do wonder if anyone has studied that. Whether addiction is viral at a biological level. It sounds bizarre, but I wonder if there's some truth to it.

Kiva tried to get people addicted to volunteering. They're using all the classical social media tactics of securing engagement. The mechanism is very clever even, that idea of microlending and re-using the same pot of money over and over to make yourself feel better for cheaper.

Why aren't volunteer organizations more transparent about where every single dollar goes? It wouldn't exactly be hard to track. You SHOULD be able to model it by just looking at how your expenditures break down by percentage. Right now people have this stupid, vaguely suspicious attitude towards ALL non-profits. They conflate the phrase "non-profit" with "pass-through organization", where all funds merely pass through like the organization like a free tunnel into a third-world country of your choosing. Forget the fact that the only reason you can even donate is because some entity built this tunnel. How DARE they try to maintain the tunnel and keep it open for other people to donate! If all was just in the world, your piddling donation should be the last one through the tunnel, upon which it collapses into a singularity and no donation shall ever pass through again.
