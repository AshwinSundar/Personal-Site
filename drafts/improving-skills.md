# Getting Better (working title)
Improving your skillset

Date: October 14th, 2022

Getting better at something requires consistent practice. Consistent practice requires discipline, which is far more valuable than interest in a subject, which can be fleeting. 

So what happens when you stop doing something consistently? Things happen in life, both intentional and unintentional. You can't always devote your undivided attention to a topic for months or years on end. You can't even continuously devote an hour a day sometimes. 

One common theme I've found in my life is that in my pursuit of excellence, I plateau. This plateau is always temporary, but I never how long it will last. It can last for weeks, months, or even years. I can (and have) devoted an hour a day to some skill or hobby I'm passionate about for months and years on end, with no appreciable improvement in my skill. 

Am I studying the wrong thing? Perhaps. Have I reached the peak of my ability as a human? Unless it's a raw physical skill I'm developing, then it's unlikely. 

In situations like this, the best solution I've found is to unplug entirely. Just walk away from the activity and don't put another thought towards it. When it comes time to return and resume the practice, I find myself invariably worse off skill-wise than before, but not as much as I expected. This alerts me to the fact that my skill-level has declined, and that I have some ground to make up. But I'm also motivated, because I now realize that I DO have an ability to improve at this skill, because I know that I once was better at it. So my motivation is rejuvenated. 

Paradoxically, I also seem to forget that I don't know how to do something. For example, there are certain guitar riffs that I have spent YEARS trying to learn. I can spend all the energy and time I want on trying to perfect the riff, but I just can't seem to get it. On occassion I will put down the guitar entirely for up to a couple of months at a time, perhaps to go on vacation. And I'll find when I return, I'll have forgotten that I can't play that riff. And it will just seem to come naturally (after a bit of practice). It's so strange.

The best thing to do when it's time to unplug is to do that - unplug entirely. Forget what you do and don't know, because those put strange constraints on your ability from a purely mental level.

Even this act right now - writing - feels a bit foreign because I've been out of practice for about a month. But I'm here, practicing again, and hopefully forgetting that I'm not capable of writing in a certain way or about certain topics.
