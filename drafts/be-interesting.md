# Be an interesting person

In the winter quarter of my freshman year of college, I took LS2 - Cell Biology, taught by Professor Jay Phelan. He was well-known in the pop-science community for having written "Mean Genes", a book about evolution and aging. He was also an interesting and engaging professor who shared his various life experiences through the course of the class.

He concluded the final lecture with a piece of advice that I have frequently thought about. 

`Many of you in this class will go on to become important people in medicine and life sciences some day. But don't let that be the entirety of your identity. In life, it's important to focus on being an interesting person.`[^ucla]

*Be an interesting person*. Of course that's desirable, 18-year-old me thought.  

But what does that mean? I have wondered this for many years now. Since that last lecture, I have tried to *be an interesting person* in many ways. Subconsciously, it has driven many of the strange decisions I've made.

In my life there have been several times where two paths were available. The first - common, easy and prestigious. The second - unknown, difficult, and of questionable value. Many times I chose the latter, hoping to _be an interesting person_ as a result of choosing the path less chosen.

Those times rarely "worked out". I didn't always learn something when things failed. One thing this approach did create, however, is interesting stories. I worked in a coffee shop for 2 years. I tried to start a doggy-photography business (and failed)[^starbucks]. Someone stole a falafel from me in Amsterdam[^falafel]. All these happened because I tried to pursue a path that most of my peers didn't choose.

Through this process of making decisions based on whether I will *become more interesting*, I've learned a few lessons.

## Avoid garbage

In American society, we are often presented with garbage wrapped in a nice bow. We are convinced that garbage is not, in fact, garbage. Our personal space is assaulted with advertisements that garbage is actually luxury. We need this garbage to take us wherever we want. We need garbage to *be an interesting person*[^garbage]. 

[literal ad with the words "be interesting"]
[or maybe a bunch of them]

This is wrong. Garbage, not matter how decorated and ornate, is still garbage. A glass of water tainted by even the tiniest amount of poop is no longer safe to drink - it's 100% poopy water.  

One should learn to recognize garbage and avoid it. This includes obvious garbage in the form of food. The best food advice I have ever received is to educate oneself about ingredients and read the ingredients label of everything one consumes[^food-advice]. If any ingredient is unrecognizable, or known to be bad - don't consume the item. It's that simple.

Then there is visual and auditory garbage - low quality filler videos that one watches before going to bed, crappy podcasts to listen to while puttering about the house. This can go too. How much of that information is actually retained? What damage does poorly-researched filler content do to one's critical reasoning skills? 

Finally, there is the non-obvious garbage - sensual garbage. As a general rule of thumb, for daily use, one should only allow [natural fibers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_fiber) to contact the skin. It seems that every decade or so, a synthetic fiber previously believed to be safe is found to cause long-lasting damage to the body and/or the environment [^nih].  

I believe that garbage consumption precludes individuality. We think the same thoughts, believe the same beliefs, wear the same things - just because corporate, government, or societal interests have decided that's the best way for everything to run. Listening to the man is the opposite of being interesting.  

## Push your limits frequently

On a recent trip, I visited the big island of Hawai'i. Hawai'i is a reminder that the Earth is still beautiful, pristine, and untainted in some places.

I stayed in a hostel for one week, during which time I met a young man from Scandinavia who was planning to hike *Mauna Kea*, the tallest mountain in Hawai'i (and in the world if measured from it's base at the ocean's floor). I was astonished - he looked about the same fitness level as me. After he returned, I inquired about the hike and learned that while difficult, it was not as infeasible as I previously thought. 

While traveling, I take things day-by-day. As a result, the last few days of my stay in Kailua-Kona were unplanned. While pondering what to do, it hit me - *I should hike to the top of Mauna Kea*.  

<!-- resume editing from here -->

As soon as I had the thought, my first reaction was fear. 


*I didn't pack all my hiking gear!*

*I haven't hiked at that altitude in years, am I prepared?*

I also considered the fact that I was flying to Japan in 3 days. If anything went wrong, it would jeopardize the remainder of the trip. 

But then I also considered the fact that I have lived in Colorado for 6 years, spent the entire summer biking in town as well as some high-elevation rides, and am in some of the best shape of my life. I have also hiked at altitude many times and know how to prepare. So if any time is right, now is it. 

I headed to Target in tropical Kona, where I literally bought the last pair of gloves and hat they had, stocked up on electrolytes and food, and packed my bag for the next morning. I got up early the next day, drove to the visitor center, and over the course of 6 hours, pushed my boundaries in a way I didn't think was possible just a few days prior.

The moral here is - push your physical and mental limits frequently. 

## Change your mind

Now a professor of philosophy, Jake Nebel is a name I remember from my time on the national debate circuit. The difference was that he was very goodi at debate, and I was not. He wrote an article a number of years ago that was prescient for its time. Titled ["Changing our Minds"](https://victorybriefs.substack.com/p/201208changing-our-minds), it really spoke to debaters, who are notorious for being stubborn and argumentative. The article explained that we should all allow ourselves rooms to change our minds when presented with new information. It's such a simple tenet, yet something that very few public figures ever actually do. This behavior bleeds into the rest of society, to the point where a hallmark of maturity in American culture is the extreme reticence to change opinions.  

This is completely wrong. It's important to talk to many people with many different ideas of how the world should work. We need to be open to new ideas and even try adopting them on faith, even if they are unconventional or make you look silly. Life is too short to be spent living in an uninteresting and carefully curated bubble.

[^starbucks]: From 2014 to 2016 I worked at Starbucks while attending ASU for graduate school. For one of the semesters, three days a week, I woke up at 230AM, worked a full 8-hour shift, then went to school in the afternoon. I also wrote a little bit of Starbucks fan-fiction that was minorly appreciated on Reddit. Maybe I'll dig up those posts one day and post them as an article.  
[^falafel]: In 2022, I made a radical change by quitting my job at Medtronic and moving to work for a consulting firm. Later that year, we were invited to Amsterdam for a work retreat. Prior to the event, I was staying in Amsterdam and ordered a falafel from a Mediterranean restaurant near my hotel. While trying to quietly eat the falafel, a man approached me and asked to borrow my phone. I said no, so he stole my falafel from me instead.
