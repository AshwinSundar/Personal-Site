# Be an interesting person

In the winter quarter of my freshman year of college, I took LS2 - Cell Biology, taught by Professor Jay Phelan. He was well-known in the pop-science community for having written "Mean Genes", a book about evolution and aging. He was also an interesting and engaging professor who shared his various life experiences through the course of the class.

He concluded the final lecture with a piece of advice that I have frequently thought about. He said something along the lines of, many of you in this class will go on to become important people in medicine and life sciences some day. But don't let that be the entirety of your identity. In life, it's important to focus on being an interesting person.  

*Be an interesting person*. Of course that's desirable, 18-year-old me thought.  

But what does that mean? I have wondered this for many years now. Since that last lecture, I have tried to *be an interesting person* in many ways. Subconsciously, it has driven many of the strange decisions I've made.

In my life there have been several times where two paths were available. The first - common, easy and prestigious. The second - unknown, difficult, and of questionable value. Many times I chose the latter. Those times rarely "worked out", and I didn't always learn something when things failed. But this approach to have produced more interesting stories than I might have otherwise had.  

Through this process of making decisions based on whether I will *become more interesting* by the end, I've learned a few lessons.  

## Don't consume garbage

In American society, we are often presented with garbage wrapped in a nice bow. We are convinced that garbage is not, in fact, garbage. Our personal space is assaulted with advertisements that garbage is actually luxury. We need this garbage to take us wherever we want. We need garbage to *be an interesting person*.  

This is wrong. Garbage, not matter how surrounded by decorations it is, is still garbage. A glass of clear water tainted by even the smallest amount of chemicals is not still 99.9% pure - it's 100% lethal.  

So one should learn to recognize garbage, and avoid it. This includes obvious garbage in the form of food. The best advice I got is to educate oneself about ingredients and read the ingredients label of everything one consumes. If any ingredient is unrecognizable, or known to be bad - don't consume the item. It's that simple. Beyond that, one can shop at higher-quality grocery stores (budget-permitting) and research organic supplements that can be safely added to the diet. 

Then there is the visual and auditory garbage - low quality filler videos that one watches before going to bed, crappy podcasts to listen to while puttering about the house. This can go too. Nothing of value is missed when one forgoes the news entirely, for example.  

Finally, there is the non-obvious garbage - sensual garbage. As a general rule of thumb, for daily use, one should only allow [natural fibers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_fiber) to contact the skin. It seems that every decade or so, a synthetic fiber previously believed to be safe is found to cause long-lasting damage to the body and/or the environment [^1].  

I believe that consuming garbage makes someone just like everyone else - we all end up thinking the same way, believing the same things, wearing the same things - just because corporate, government, or societal interests have decided that's the best way for everything to run. Listening to the man is the opposite of being interesting.  

## Push your limits frequently

On a recent trip, I visited the big island of Hawai'i. Hawai'i is a reminder that the Earth is still beautiful, pristine, and untainted in some places. 

I stayed in a hostel for one week, during which time I met a young man from Scandinavia who was planning to hike *Mauna Kea*, the tallest mountain in Hawai'i (and in the world if measured from it's base at the ocean floor). I was astonished - he looked about the same fitness level as me. After he returned, I inquired about the hike and learned that while difficult, it was not as infeasible as I previously thought. I proceeded with my plans of exploring the island over the next couple days, and when pondering what to do for the last two days it hit me - *I should hike to the top of Mauna Kea*. 

As soon as I had the thought, my first reaction was fear. 

*I didn't pack all my hiking gear!*

*I haven't hiked at that altitude in several months, am I prepared?*

I also considered the fact that I was flying to Japan in 3 days, and if anything went wrong, I would be jeoparidizing the remainder of the trip. 

But then I also considered the fact that I have lived in Colorado for 6 years, spent the entire summer biking in town as well as some high-elevation rides, and am in some of the best shape of my life. I have also hiked at altitude many times and know how to prepare. So if any time is right, now is it. 

I headed to Target, where I literally bought the last pair of gloves and hat they had, stocked up on electrolytes and food, and packed my bag for the next morning. I got up early the next day, drove to the visitor center, and over the course of 6 hours, pushed my boundaries in a way I didn't think was possible just a few days prior.  

The moral here is - push your physical and mental limits frequently. 

## Change your mind

A number of years ago, a debater I looked up wrote an article about "Changing your mind". Unfortunately, that article is no longer available on the web. But the general gist was that we should all allow ourselves rooms to change our minds when presented with new information. It's such a simple tenet, yet something that very few public figures ever actually do. This behavior bleeds into the rest of society, to the point where a hallmark of maturity in American culture is the extreme reticence to change opinions.  

This is completely wrong. It's important to talk to many people with many different ideas of how the world should work. We need to be open to new ideas and even try adopting them on faith, even if they are unconventional or make you look silly. Life is too short to be spent living in an uninteresting and carefully curated bubble.
