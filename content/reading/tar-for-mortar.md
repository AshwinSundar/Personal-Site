I lack the background to follow the philosophical connections Basile makes. I did appreciate the contradiction and impossibility in trying to describe the layout and architecture of the library. I also liked how Basile revealed the algorithm behind his website, www.libraryofbabel.info, something I have wondered about for years and wish to recreate some day.
