When might one prefer to use object-oriented design to model a system using software, versus a function-oriented (i.e. functional) design paradigm?

In Scenario A, consider the following problem:

> A system is composed of a number of physical objects that must be modeled. These objects, all solids and made of the same materials, interact within themselves, with each other, and with the system as a whole. You might imagine a giant bouncy castle full of rubber spheres, rubber cubes, rubber cylinders, and so on.

Let's say we are tasked with the joyous task of modeling such an ecosystem. How might we approach this problem?

One strategy is to (do something suboptimal, but rational)

Another strategy is to (a little better, but still has problems)

The last strategy, as you may have guessed, is to treat each object as, well, an object.
