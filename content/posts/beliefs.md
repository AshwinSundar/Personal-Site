Some things I currently believe, in 2024, at the age of 32:

- Judge the content, not the person
- Raise the ceiling, and show people how to get there
  - In other words - don't meet them down there, bring them up here.
- Recognize when you're ahead
- Information is as important as food - only consume the best
- It's better to die being the person you want to be, than to live as someone else

This next section is for me, just so I remember why I wrote these things[^why]

- **Judge the content, not the person.** This means that the things which are said are what matter, not the person who said them. Everything new idea should be justified, not merely posited and reliant on the person who said them, in order for the idea to have meaning. Many people say very dumb things while cringing next to titles and accolades.

- **Raise the ceiling** - This is about making things that other people use. People learn when they are challenged, not reduced in stature to the least common person. Plenty of companies are making us dumber, let's fight back by making everyone smarter.

- **Recognize when you're ahead** - There isn't much else to say here.

- **Information is as important as food** - This topic has really been beaten to death by every academic our there, so I'll spare the point. But somehow everyone ignores this. So it does bear repeating - **only consume the best**.

Many important people talk about being yourself. 

> It's surprising how hard we'll work when the work is done just for ourselves.
> *Bill Watterson, Kenyon College 1990 Commencement Speech*

> When did mediocrity and banality become a good image for your children?
> *Bill Hicks, ~1991*

> Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice, heart, and intuition.
> *Steve Jobs, Stanford University 2005 Commencement Speech*

[^why]: Then why write this down in public, Mr. Conceit? Because, as you correctly indicate, I re-read my public posts from time-to-time. Private notes? Not so much. They're scattered across half a dozen mediums; I'm not organized at all, I just let thoughts fly away.
