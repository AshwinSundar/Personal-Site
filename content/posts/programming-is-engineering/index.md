Some people say that computer science isn't engineering. They're right. Computer science is the field of first principles, much like physics and chemistry are to mechanical engineering and chemical engineering.â€¨Computer science itself is an abstraction layer to another field - mathematics. Depending on what one works on, they may be closer on the spectrum to "applied mathematics" than "computer science".

This is true for other engineering fields as well. Some mechanical engineers are closer to physics than others, perhaps just by the nature of their industry. Same with chemical engineers.

Software engineering is the applied portion of computer science. That also makes it the "applied applied" portion of mathematics. Programmers talk about [abstraction layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_layer) in languages. They are by far the leading experts in all fields of creating and thinking about abstraction layers. They are so good at it, that they've turn their entire field into an abstraction layer itself.
