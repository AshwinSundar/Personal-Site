# Resume-Bot

Date: December 1st, 2022

First of all, I need to come up with a better name than Resume-Bot, it's just a placeholder for now. 

Second - I really, really like this idea of an AI chatbot that knows my work history. I think I need to train the bot on a few pieces of information. 
	- First, the actual resume, I's just the written history of my schooling and career experience. It has to be all my report cards and grades, not just the ones I choose to highlight. I can also feed it my LinkedIn resume. So now it knows my concrete details.
	- Second, I have to just start talking to it about me. It has to know how *I* personally think of myself. How I talk about myself. Fortunately, I write ~~too much~~ a lot, so I'll go find all those journal entries about my work and what I think of myself and feed that into the machine.

I think this project is cool for a number of other reasons. When I come up with big projects like this, my biggest downfall is going and researching if anyone else has done something similar, and then losing interest when I find out someone has. I should remember that this is unique because *I* am doing it, and not anyone else. So it will be unique in that there are no other chat bots of myself out there.  

What am I creating? It's not just a way for me to try and automate my way out of a job interview. I'm not sure if I even want that anyway.  

In some way, I'm creating a clone of myself. Almost like some sort of virtual horcrux, but it's not really evil. It's just like this strange copy of me that will float around the web forever. I can't take it back, not really. I guess I could shut it down, but that would never close the can of worms this opens. 

I don't really know what the result of doing this weird project is. It probably will die into obscurity. Maybe I can get my 15 minutes of fame or whatever.

I'd like to write more about the philosophical side of things once this is all said and done. At the very least this makes for interesting writing fodder.
