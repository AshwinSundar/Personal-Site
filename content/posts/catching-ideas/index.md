It's not a good idea to maximize catching ideas.

The brain needs time to refresh itself. This is not meant to be a scientific claim by any means, merely a psychological observation. When an idea arrives, don't race to write it down. Chew on it for a while. Let it stew. Turn it into food for thought.

Even this particular idea right now - that ideas aren't precious - has been with me for some time. I only just figured out what the core thesis is.

Some symptoms that a person may be over-optimizing idea-catching:

- Excessive proccess-ification of their daily life

- An obsession over electronic tools for note-taking

- Vulnerability to burn-out

Instead, let ideas wash over you, like waves in an ocean. After a while, you'll start to see a pattern to things. Once the pattern is apparent, only then, try and pluck it from the water.
