With nothing left but faith, what is left[^title-expl]? What do we actually believe in? What are the things that we think, if not figments of our imaginations?

I don't know, and can never know. Every moment of every human existence is completely unique, across either time or space. No two moments experienced by any two humans is ever more than nearly identical. We all approach this life with our own set of preconditions, of experiences, of beliefs or understandings. 

So what's left, then? If it's all faith, then why do things work out? Shouldn't things occur no better than the roll of dice? Is human agency not a thing? Is every outcome necessarily chaotic in nature?

From what I've observed in my brief time here, there is some agency left. In fact, that's all each individual human seems to have - is the ability to make a decision. Society will do it's best to condition us to believe otherwise - that is, have faith that everything works out even without self-agency. 

But society shouldn't be trusted on this one[^ramblings]. Nothing happens, if we as individuals choose to do nothing. Indecision paralysis afflicts many people. This is the inability to make decisions before they become necessary[^indecision]. Our hands will eventually get forced by any decision that needs to be made, regardless of what we desire[^caveat].

Every moment has its time. Being 20 is fun, but would one wish to be 20 for the rest of their life? Every moment gets old, every moment gets boring. It's more fun to reminisce about the past, than to live in it perpetually. So I guess what I'm saying, mainly to myself, is just move on. Life is supposed to be a chapter storybook, not a run-on sentence.

[^title-expl]: This writing was inspired by the song "Faith" by The Cure. I listened to this song on repeat until this writing was complete. This explanation is self-indulgent, but I hope it helps someone similar to me understand their mind better.

[^indecision]: In my estimation.

[^caveat]: I'm no philosopher. All I do as cosplay as one. I'm just trying to make sense of the world through the brain and senses I was given. Only those who are still alive get to undergo this process.

[^ramblings]: The ramblings of an upset teenager, trapped in a 30-something mind.
