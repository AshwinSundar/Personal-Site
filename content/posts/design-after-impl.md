Thesis: 

- Code is needlessly complicated when it is insisted that UI design is completed before code implementation.

Alternative: 

- Explain for a few paragraphs the alternative (do the design AFTER code has been written)
- Form follows function
- Why this is better
  - Better decisions about code organization. Default tends to be to organize around features visible to the end-user, rather along more clearly definable technical or engineering boundaries. 
  - Technical boundaries enable better analysis practices, e.g. defining boundaries of analysis for purpose of determining probabilities and impacts of failure of various aspects of the application


Conclusion:
- UI design follows code = Form follows function

Like the architectural principle of "Form follows function", in software development, we should extend and adopt the adage with "Design follows code".
