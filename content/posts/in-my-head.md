I fear being close to others because I fear the return of voices in my head. These voices always take on the form of people close to me, and turn into demons. They won't let me sleep or let me live in the moment. It is only when I am alone, do I hear the universe most clearly.

Everything becomes quiet and clear when I'm alone. That is when I have learned who I actually am. 

People say that transcendental meditation and therapy apps are the correct cure for this mental state. But why is this state something that must be cured? I have never understood that.

Somehow, I find myself growing close to people I don't know. Writers, musicians, comedians, TV characters. Their distance somehow makes them easier to understand, than those closest to me. It's *their* thoughts which I wish to hear more of.

Why do I choose this path of pseudo-psychoanalysis of myself? I've done this for most of my life, ever since I was old enough to question things. I have hundreds of notes like this, scattered across multiple different versions of me. As each year passes by, the notes become more and more uncertain. Isn't it supposed to be the other way? Wasn't I supposed to understand more and more things as I got older? It seems like everyone else is. Everyone else moved on and matured.

I thought we were all being serious as teenagers when we thought the world was a joke. Now it feels like everyone is joking by taking everything seriously. I've messed up relationships with friends and family by not taking things seriously enough.

This writing demands a resolution and conclusion, but neither come to mind.
