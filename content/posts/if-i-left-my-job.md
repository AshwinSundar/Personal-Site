If I quit my job, what would I do?

I would sit outside for 2 hours, every day. Rain or shine or snow. My yard is a refuge for all sorts of animals, and it is amazing to see them interact with each other.  

- A group of three squirrels love to chase each other around trees, and wrestle in the grass.
- Both the blue jays and the robins have picked a fight with at least one of the squirrels. Or maybe it’s the other way around. I want to know the story.
- At least one of the squirrels has very bizarre tics and thrashings. It sometimes go slightly mad and does flips and bounces around, like a particularly crazy gymnast.

I would also read, quite a bit more. Like everyone else, my attention span has been whittled down considerably. I once read long, long novels. I haven’t done that in a while. Reading is now an activity to fall asleep. But not much is learned at that time.  

I would aspire to keep a daily, public journal. To document where my state of mind is. This navel-gazing does serve some purpose. It allows for self-reflection. A public journal shares a window that others can peer through. When I’ve learned something new, I have found a lot of value in learning how others learned the topic. Especially if their way is particularly unorthodox. So I’m motivated to return the favor to anyone who is the same.

After I was done “lazing about”, I would partake in physical activity, letting the mind liquefy. And when the time was ready, I would begin work. Each new beginning involves a “discovery” of “work”, that is - what feels right to do today? The preachings of Agile, Scrum, Six Sigma, Lean variously throughout my career, so I Know The Ways (KTW) and Shall Not Be Derailed (ShNoDe). It’s impossible to be a true creative in the modern world, such as like [this](an excerpt or link or quote from Emile), some odd hippie stories. Whatever feels right here.

What kind of employed person works like that???

The worst ones, exactly. They are in tune with themselves. They know what they Want and Where they are going. They obstinately, single-mindedly, to-a-fault - refuse guidance. 

Who can hire someone like that, and then work with them? You have a question for them at 11 AM, but they are too busy “preparing for work”. Instead of doing it!

Someone like that can’t be micromanaged. They can’t even be normally managed. They need special kid gloves to interact with. Kid gloves to hand them their 6-figure salary and wooden, engraved box o’ benefits to.

Another thing to know is: quitting a well-paying job doesn’t take true courage. It takes “privileged-people courage”. It’s when someone voluntarily chooses to downgrade their quality of life, knowing that they have unlimited safety nets to catch them. You have more in common with those people, than the people you wish to sympathize with.
