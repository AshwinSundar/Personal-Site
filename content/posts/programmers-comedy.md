# Programmer's Comedy[^disclaimer]

I'm not a one-trick pony;  
I can do more things.  
This is my, quote, "rally cry!"  
for my interview at 3. 

I'm not a one-trick pony;  
I can do more things.  
Want to see a new haiku?  
Off course you do, it's free.  

Experts have systems.  
Systems programmers have Rust.  
That is my haiku.  

"That's not so bad,  
But we're dying here, you see."  
The Humanities reply,  
As you avoid eye-to-eye.  

"Humanities require more Vespene Gas!"  
"Not enough minerals!", you cry back.  
"We need more Rust developers!  
Can you spare us one or 3?"  

"What's Rust?", they ask.  
"WHAT'S RUST???", you scream.  
"...what?" they timidly ask?  
"Child, pray, and heed."

Read this brief primer.  
It's only five hun-dred pages long.  
If that doesn't light The Borrow Way,  
Then we shall write you a song[^meter].

Rusty rusty rusty, can't you see?  
Sometimes your adwords just hypnotize me.  
I can write this flashy jinx,  
Guess-that's-why-(software)-engineers all get the big links.

"You're kidding, right?"  
The Humanities cry.  
"Keep the change, ya filthy animal.  
Just give us the receipt."
