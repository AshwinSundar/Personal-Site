### Hypothesis

The lower the level of abstraction in an application, the easier it is to interface with other applications. 

### Definitions

`application`: A piece of code written in a domain of knowledge I'm familiar with. 

### Criteria

"Ease" is defined as speed at which a 99% correct implementation can be developed by a programmer with familiarity in the domain. This can mean they have hands-on experience in the field and understand some of the jargon.
