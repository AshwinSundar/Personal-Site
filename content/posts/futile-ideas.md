"The only ideas worth pursuing are the futile ones," remarked Britton. Having failed to bring a barometer, they closed the door. When writer's block strikes, Britton grows closed and recessive. Terse words, a blank expression, lethargy - these are but some of the characteristics of the silenced writer. These characteristics are sometimes mistaken as "symptoms", and those "symptoms" spell depression - but they are not those.
