Some of my earliest computer memories:

- My first encounter with "online gaming" was a game called Fire Fight, released in 1996. I was only 4 or 5 at the time. I remember my dad putting a computer in my room, and running a wire that connected to the computer in his room. He then somehow got us to both play the same game on both computers, and apparently at the same time! I could fly my ship around, and at the same time see his ship flying around. It was more than my young brain could handle at the time, and left a very deep impression on me about something I would later learn is called "technology".

- The first video game I can ever remember playing was Sonic the Hedgehog for Sega Genesis. I must have been under the age of 5 again, because all I can remember is pestering my brother to let me play as Tails, which he must have convinced me is possible because he handed me a controller, but secretly unplugged it while I wasn't looking.

- The first video game that left an impression on me was Final Fantasy VII, released in 1998 for the Sony Playstation. My brother and I played the game religiously. I learned how to use a search engine for the first time, a website called `mamma.com`. I would "research" strategies for playing the game, which felt brilliant - not like cheating. The number of children who knew how to use a computer in 1999 was extremely small, especially compared to today.

- I loved computers, but hardly ever "programmed" them when I was young. I was familiar with a lot of "indirect" programming, which is probably considered "low-code programming today". I knew how to search the web and install new programs. I knew how to boot to BIOS, but I had no idea what to do in there. Later, I learned HTML from using neopets.com and myspace, like many of those in my generation.

- I didn't "speak" computers, as in write a program in a real programming language, until I was 20. I accidentally enrolled in a "Program in Computing"[^pic] introductory course, designed to teach non-engineering majors about programming. There I was, a biosciences major who hadn't taken any math courses whatosever in 2 years, trying to grok C. To put it bluntly, it went poorly. I despised that class so much that I refused to write more code for years afterwards.

[^pic]: I have no clue what it was named that. We all just referred to it as PIC 10A.
