<p><strong>Education</strong> - Children educated in British India went on to become world class researchers, including:</p>
<p><strong>Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman</strong>: (b. 1888 in Tiruchirapalli, Madras Presidency, British India): 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovery of Raman scattering</p>
<p><strong>Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar</strong>: (b. 1910 in Lahore, Punjab, British India): 1983 Nobel Peace Prize for Physics for &ldquo;&hellip;theoretical studies of the physical processes of importance to the structure and evolution of the stars&rdquo;</p>
