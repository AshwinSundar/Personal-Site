<p>December 2023</p>
<p>I will be deleting my LinkedIn profile at the end of this year. For many years, this site served its purpose of keeping me connected with colleagues and mentors. However, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">decay of the platform</a> over the last couple of years has made it such that I no longer wish to participate.</p>
<p>What began as a resume-builder and jobs board has turned into a full-fledged social media website, with all the negative externalities that entails. Features such as the news feed, recommendations, and community-curated articles enable algorithmic bias, extend surveillance capitalism, and spread misinformation. Disturbingly, LinkedIn annihilates the idea of meritocracy in the workplace, and instead promotes people who are good at posting to social media.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Accumulating “recommendations” and “endorsements” are how one accumulates flair. Tactics like timing posts such that colleagues see it during their lunch break or on the way home is the newest form of soft-power in the workplace. Carefully crafted posts that parrot one’s employer’s media guidelines are how one builds clout. Writing in passive voice and third-person about topics, in a vague and circumspect manner, with strange punctuation, is how one gets &ldquo;reactions&rdquo; - the social currency of LinkedIn<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<hr>
<p>No one cares about a LinkedIn poster’s vapid, uninformed opinions on domestic or world affairs. Repeating a company’s social mantras doesn’t make someone a good person. It makes them a corporate shill. They are polluting everyone else’s minds with corporate propaganda.</p>
<p>In the office, most people are reluctant to speak about political affairs. In my opinion, this is appropriate - we are there to work, not chat about irrelevant politics. But surfing LinkedIn isn’t work - it’s work-adjacent, with a splash of networking. The top LinkedIn influencers (Linkfluencers?) spend inordinate amounts of time curating their LinkedIn persona and crafting ornate opinions on topics they know nothing about.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The worst part is, all of these opinions align with whatever their respective company wants them to say. The result is that opinions on LinkedIn are a corporatocracy of ideas. No one with an original or interesting idea will ever share it on LinkedIn. This site represents all of the things I have come to despise about corporate culture.</p>
<p>LinkedIn is the last piece of rent-seeking social media that I use. It feels appropriate to delete my profile and end reliance on social media altogether. I have other plans that I believe will more than compensate for the lack of visibility on the most popular jobs board.</p>
<p>I am fortunate to work in a field where completed work matters more than talk. It is more productive for me to focus on personal projects, and detail them on my personal website {link to some of your side projects}.</p>
<p>With this website, I seek to fulfill the dream of Web 1.0 - freedom of expression, democratization of information, and creative exploration. Through my personal site, I am free to explore any technical or non-technical (links to each) topic that I desire.</p>
<p>So with that, goodbye LinkedIn! Thanks for the dozens of recruiter emails that inquire if I would like to work in a totally unrelated field for two-thirds of my current salary. Thanks for infusing my mornings with unintelligent technical discussions about Artificial Intelligence. Thanks for inviting me to &ldquo;collaborative articles&rdquo;, which surely are some way to train Microsoft&rsquo;s evil AI machine.</p>

<p>Original post to LinkedIn for posteriority:</p>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I will be deleting my LinkedIn profile at the end of this year. This site has served its purpose of keeping me connected with colleagues and mentors. However, the decay of the platform (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification</a>) over the last couple of years has made it such that I no longer wish to participate in this corporatocracy of ideas. Feel free to read my full thoughts [here].</p>
<p>Say hi at <a href="mailto:hi@ashwinsundar.com">hi@ashwinsundar.com</a>!</p>
<p>Happy holidays! Stay sane!</p>
