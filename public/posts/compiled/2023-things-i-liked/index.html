<h1 id="software-i-liked-in-2023">Software I liked in 2023</h1>
<p>Here are some software programs I liked<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> in
2023<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p><strong>mermaid.js</strong> - Excellent tool for creating
architecture (and other) diagrams from text. Add to a markdown file with
special syntax. Renders in GitHub natively. Has some bugs, but team
seems to have a good head on its shoulders and should hopefully work
them out soon. <font color = "green"><strong>8/10</strong></font></p>
<p><strong>VSCode</strong> - One of the few things Microsoft hasn’t
totally screwed up yet. Plug-in ecosystem is enormous.
<font color = "green"><strong>9/10</strong></font></p>
<p><strong>Vim</strong> - At the other end of the spectrum. I forced
myself to learn keybindings last year and now I can’t not use them. I
find myself unable to use text editors that lack a “vim mode”. 2Bi” -
fixed that missing quote! I find the extension ecosystem a bit puzzling
still - extensions I install never seem to work quite right. Having to
memorize extra keybindings for each plugin maxes out my mental load.
<font color = "green"><strong>8/10</strong></font></p>
<p><strong>DigitalOcean</strong> - A breath of fresh air compared to
AWS. There are fewer services and quite a lot of abstraction. It fills
the gap between walking to work and flying a fighter jet there. DO
support has been super prompt and helpful the two times I’ve contacted
them (even on the free support tier). If you need three+ 9’s of
reliability, call Amazon, Microsoft, or Google. For everything else
there’s DigitalOcean.
<font color = "green"><strong>9/10</strong></font></p>
<p><strong>Django</strong> - The first time I’ve enjoyed web development
in quite some time. The abstraction level can get a bit silly at times,
but I find that it’s easy to peel back the layers of the onion, so to
speak, and troubleshoot the inner workings. Still plagued by runtime
errors. Maybe I’m bad at writing Python. <code>mypy</code> and
<code>typeddjango/django-stubs</code> just don’t cut it for me. I want
more compile-time errors!
<font color = "green"><strong>8/10</strong></font></p>
<p><strong>Logic Pro</strong> - Technically started using it in late
2021 but really got more into it this year. Used to produce music for a
group of friends that play together. Tons of keybindings. Interface can
get confusing, but it’s a powerful tool.
<font color = "green"><strong>9/10</strong></font></p>
<p><strong>regex101.com</strong> - I am <em>alright</em> at constructing
regular expressions. I wish I was better. I ordered “Mastering Regular
Expressions”, but just couldn’t get excited about reading 542 pages on
regular expressions. If regex101.com didn’t exist, this might not have
happened:</p>

I’m sorry, Mr. Friedl. It’s me, not you.

<p><strong>news.ycombinator.com</strong> - A basic message board for the
tech cabal. Where <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientism">scientism-ists</a> meet
scientific skeptics. If you ever wondered what a world would look like
where everyone studies STEM and nothing else, read the comments. If you
think all libertarians are smart, read the comments. I enjoy the
throwback to the year 2002, never-changing design, and complete lack of
an algorithm to recommend news. If you ever wondered what a message
board in the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)">fictional</a>
<em>Three-Body</em> video game would be like, this is it<a href="#fn3"
