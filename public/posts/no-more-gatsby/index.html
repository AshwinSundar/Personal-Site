<p>Date: August 1st, 2022</p>
<p>The original version of this website was written using GatsbyJS, a headless CMS engine that&rsquo;s all the rage right now in the world of web development. After a few weeks, I learned that it was tremendously overkill for a personal website with maybe a few dozen pages (including all my blog posts). Most importantly though, GatsbyJS is bloated with dependencies that take forever for me troubleshoot when all I want to do is add support for MathML.</p>
<p>The zipped, compressed, ready-to-deploy GatsbyJS package is 18.6 MEGABYTES. For a couple dozen pages. It&rsquo;s nuts. I&rsquo;m a little scared of looking at how big the uncompressed source code is&hellip;<em>waiting for Mac Finder to calculate size</em>&hellip;1.03 GIGABYTES for 62 THOUSAND items??? Are you kidding me??? How many NPM modules do I need to run this tiny site???</p>
<p>I got fed up with learning what I consider non-value-add information about a fad-ish website-building engine, and decided to go back to basics.</p>
<p>I threw it all away. I got a bit overzealous, and threw away Javascript too. That&rsquo;s right - this site is written entirely in HTML and CSS. That&rsquo;s it. This decision was driven partially about seeking the most minimal toolset possible (which I believe I have achieved), and also by my disdain for the anti-intellectual patterns present in Javascript and the community. But who knows, maybe I&rsquo;ll bring back Javascript. Or maybe I&rsquo;ll hook this site up to Rust + WebAssembly, a side project I&rsquo;ve wanted to pursue for a while now anyways.</p>
<p>I also plan to working in software development for a while, and will likely own this website for decades of my working lifetime. I want something that&rsquo;s future-proof. I can guarantee that exactly 0 of the popular frameworks today will be popular (or even exist) in 10-20 years. Who knows what will be popular then. I don&rsquo;t care, to be honest. And I don&rsquo;t have to, because HTML and CSS are here forever.</p>
<p>Update: August 26th, 2022
After a couple of weeks of working on other projects, I revisited my personal site to write a new blog post. And WOW it just felt second-nature to enter the code base and figure out what to do, even though I had completely forgotten about the architecture I built (2 weeks is a long time in my head). When I build stuff from the ground up, I always am wary of my poor free recall ability, and leave myself breadcrumbs as I work on things. In the case of this site, I left PLENTY of breadcrumbs, so it was a breeze to pick things up and keep working.</p>
<p>I contrast this with using GatsbyJS, which was I built this site on originally before tearing it down to the ground. Granted, this might be true for any framework that I&rsquo;m somewhat green to. Which is pretty much every framework, because web development just doesn&rsquo;t stop changing.</p>
<p>As a multidisciplinary software engineer I&rsquo;m not always working in the same field. At my first job I was working in infrastructure tooling at a medical device company. In my current job I&rsquo;m a consultant who gets move around projects every 6 months or so. I started out on a web development project, but now I&rsquo;m in an embedded project, which means I&rsquo;m not going to keep up with the web dev world for several months at least. Things will definitely change in that time, because that&rsquo;s just the nature of the twitchy field.</p>
<p>Anyway I&rsquo;m a minimalist developer so I get the most pride out of removing unnecessary code, more so than writing new code.</p>
