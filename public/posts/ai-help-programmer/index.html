<p>I am attempting to solve a homework problem that asks me to write a helper function to use in a later problem. I have gotten 95% of the way there with this function, written in Standard ML:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sml" data-lang="sml"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">fun</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">longest_string_helper</span> f sl =
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	foldl (<span style="color:#66d9ef">fn</span> (next, acc) =&gt; <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> f (next, acc) <span style="color:#66d9ef">then</span> acc <span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span> next) <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;&#34;</span> sl
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The purpose of this function is to take a function <code>f</code> and apply something called a <strong>left fold</strong> across each element of the list <em>sl</em>. Each answer is stored in an <strong>accumulator</strong>, which is instantiated to the empty string.</p>
<p>A hint in the homework suggested that the function signature for this problem should be:</p>
<p><code>val longest_string_helper = fn : (int * int -&gt; bool) -&gt; string list -&gt; string</code></p>
<p>However, the function I wrote has a function signature of:</p>
<p><code>val longest_string_helper = fn : (string * string -&gt; bool) -&gt; string list -&gt; string</code></p>
<p>The function passed in accepts a tuple <code>(string, string)</code>, when it should accept a tuple <code>(int, int)</code>.</p>
<p>I changed the initial accumulator value to <code>0</code>, but this changed the function signature to <code>(int * int -&gt; bool) -&gt; int list -&gt; int</code>. The passed-in function&rsquo;s signature was correct, but the remaining elements of the overall signature were wrong. I tried various other minor changes, with no luck. I knew the answer was within reach, but I couldn&rsquo;t find it.</p>
<p>After about two hours of reading notes, class forums, and an intense internet search, I finally resorted to asking ChatGPT-3. In the past, it has struggled to provide correct advice about Standard ML. So I warily asked it for help:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Right away, the answer is wrong. ChatGPT-3 seems to think the signature for the passed-in function is a tuple of any-type <code>'a</code> and <code>string</code> returning a <code>bool</code>, when this clearly was not the case. I next asked a follow-up question:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This answer is close! The homework does not permit using this <code>size</code> function, but it does permit <code>String.size</code>. The function signature is now correct after making these modifications:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sml" data-lang="sml"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">fun</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">longest_string_helper</span> f sl =
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	foldl (<span style="color:#66d9ef">fn</span> (next,acc) =&gt; <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> f (String.size next, String.size acc) <span style="color:#66d9ef">then</span> acc <span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span> next) <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;&#34;</span> sl
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The function signature is now <code>val longest_string_helper = fn : (int * int -&gt; bool) -&gt; string list -&gt; string</code>.</p>

<p>I learned the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Try to solve the problem without assistance - just use your brain.</li>
<li>Re-read your notes and all available class resources to gain further insight into the problem.</li>
<li>If AI assistance must be used, learn everything possible about the final solution. In my case, I wrote this short report :)</li>
</ol>
