<p><strong>mermaid.js</strong> - Excellent tool for creating architecture (and other) diagrams from text. Add to a markdown file with special syntax. Renders in GitHub natively. Has some bugs, but team seems to have a good head on its shoulders and should hopefully work them out soon. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>8/10</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><strong>VSCode</strong> - One of the few things Microsoft hasn&rsquo;t totally screwed up yet. Plug-in ecosystem is enormous. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>9/10</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><strong>Vim</strong> - At the other end of the spectrum. I forced myself to learn keybindings last year and now I can&rsquo;t not use them. I find myself unable to use text editors that lack a &ldquo;vim mode&rdquo;. 2Bi&quot; - fixed that missing quote! I find the extension ecosystem a bit puzzling still - extensions I install never seem to work quite right. Having to memorize extra keybindings for each plugin maxes out my mental load. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>8/10</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><strong>DigitalOcean</strong> - A breath of fresh air compared to AWS. There are fewer services and quite a lot of abstraction. It fills the gap between walking to work and flying a fighter jet there. DO support has been super prompt and helpful the two times I&rsquo;ve contacted them (even on the free support tier). If you need three+ 9&rsquo;s of reliability, call Amazon, Microsoft, or Google. For everything else there&rsquo;s DigitalOcean. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>9/10</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><strong>Django</strong> - The first time I&rsquo;ve enjoyed web development in quite some time. The abstraction level can get a bit silly at times, but I find that it&rsquo;s easy to peel back the layers of the onion, so to speak, and troubleshoot the inner workings. Still plagued by runtime errors. Maybe I&rsquo;m bad at writing Python. <code>mypy</code> and <code>typeddjango/django-stubs</code> just don&rsquo;t cut it for me. I want more compile-time errors! <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>8/10</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><strong>Logic Pro</strong> - Technically started using it in late 2021 but really got more into it this year. Used to produce music for a group of friends that play together. Tons of keybindings. Interface can get confusing, but it&rsquo;s a powerful tool. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>9/10</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><strong>regex101.com</strong> - I am <em>alright</em> at constructing regular expressions. I wish I was better. I ordered &ldquo;Mastering Regular Expressions&rdquo;, but just couldn&rsquo;t get excited about reading 542 pages on regular expressions. If regex101.com didn&rsquo;t exist, this might not have happened:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>news.ycombinator.com</strong> - A basic message board for the tech cabal. Where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientism">scientism-ists</a> meet scientific skeptics. If you ever wondered what a world would look like where everyone studies STEM and nothing else, read the comments. If you think all libertarians are smart, read the comments. I enjoy the throwback to the year 2002, never-changing design, and complete lack of an algorithm to recommend news. If you ever wondered what a message board in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)">fictional</a> <em>Three-Body</em> video game would be like, this is it<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>9/10</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
