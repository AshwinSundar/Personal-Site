  <h1 id="programming-is-engineering">Programming is Engineering</h1>
<p>Some people say that computer science isn&rsquo;t engineering. They&rsquo;re right. Computer science is the field of first principles, much like physics and chemistry are to mechanical engineering and chemical engineering.â€¨Computer science itself is an abstraction layer to another field - mathematics. Depending on what one works on, they may be closer on the spectrum to &ldquo;applied mathematics&rdquo; than &ldquo;computer science&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is true for other engineering fields as well. Some mechanical engineers are closer to physics than others, perhaps just by the nature of their industry. Same with chemical engineers.</p>
<p>Software engineering is, of course, the applied portion of computer science. That also makes it the &ldquo;applied applied&rdquo; portion of mathematics. Programmers talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_layer">abstraction layers</a> in languages. They are by far the leading experts in all fields of creating and thinking about abstraction layers. They are so good at it, that they&rsquo;ve turn their entire field into an abstraction layer itself.</p>
