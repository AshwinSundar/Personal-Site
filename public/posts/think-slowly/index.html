  <h1 id="think-slowly">Think Slowly</h1>
<p>January 2024</p>
<p>I recently purchased a mechanical, ergonomic, and split keyboard<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I love the idea of yet another tech gadget to keep me engaged.</p>
<p>However, I quickly found myself in over my head. This keyboard is programmable, so the first thing I did was spend several hours tweaking the keys to my exact preference. I soon learned that key placement wouldn&rsquo;t solve my immediate problem - which was the drastic reduction in my typing speed. I went from typing 100+ words-per-minute on a regular flat membrane keyboard, to a paltry 20 words-per-minute and barely able to scratch 95% accuracy.</p>
<p>After a few days, I was wondering if I had made a mistake. I tried to switch back to my regular keyboard, but was surprised to find I could no longer operate it effectively either. The only option left was to fully immerse in this new typing experience.</p>
<p>As a developer, I use <code>vim</code> keybindings a lot. Having mentally-mapped various keybindings to locations on the keyboard, I now had to painfully recall the actual key for each binding, find the location of the new key, and then precisely tap it with the correct finger.</p>
<p>Learning to use this keyboard has been a triple learning curve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning to use the correct finger for each key in an ortholinear layout</li>
<li>Learning the locations of vim keybindings and chorded commands</li>
<li>Learning to depress mechanical keys, which behave very differently from the flat membrane keys of most modern consumer keyboards</li>
</ul>
<p>I am attempting to enjoy the process. One thing I&rsquo;ve noticed is the reduced pace at which I can record my thoughts. This slowed-down process gives me more time to carefully select words for each sentence. It encourages brevity of expression.</p>
<p>In general, I have found myself thinking more slowly. When I was younger, I was in a rush to get ideas out of my head, to the point of lacking logic or cohesion. This bewildered friends and family. Over time, I found my ideas developing more slowly, but far more efficiently; and eventually reaching a lucid form, ready to share with the world.</p>
<p>I may never return to that previous record of 120 words-per-minute. My current pace of about 35 words-per-minute is rather agonizing. Hopefully I achieve a happy medium.</p>

<p>Also, the key layout is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergonomic_keyboard#Vertical_column_layout">ortholinear</a>, and the keycaps are blank. I really did myself no favors buying this thing. But the lights and clacky noises are pretty sweet!&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
