      Prefer Markdown October 2023
I have spent a lot of time writing HTML. I wrote my first HTML when I was around 12 years old. I was obsessed with a website called neopets.com, a website geared for kids to take care of virtual pets. There were games to play, coins to earn, and pets to splurge on. Items could be earned and sold in a &ldquo;shop&rdquo; to other players (for fake currency only).

      Programming is Engineering
April 2023
Some people say that computer science isn&rsquo;t engineering. They&rsquo;re right. Computer science is the field of first principles, much like physics and chemistry are to mechanical engineering and chemical engineering.â€¨Computer science itself is an abstraction layer to another field - mathematics. Depending on what one works on, they may be closer on the spectrum to &ldquo;applied mathematics&rdquo; than &ldquo;computer science&rdquo;.
This is true for other engineering fields as well.

      Programming Languages Date: October 2022
I recently began a Coursera course called &ldquo;Programming Languages&rdquo;, offered by Dan Grossman at the University of Washington. I decided to take this course because the description advertises it as a way to understand the underpinning of all programming languages more thoroughly. When I first learned to program on my own, I always assumed that once I had more experience and learned more languages, I would began to understand the commonalities and differences between programming languages, and that would be sufficient.

      Quiet-quitting LinkedIn December 2023
I will be deleting my LinkedIn profile at the end of this year. For many years, this site served its purpose of keeping me connected with colleagues and mentors. However, the decay of the platform over the last couple of years has made it such that I no longer wish to participate.
What began as a resume-builder and jobs board has turned into a full-fledged social media website, with all the negative externalities that entails.

      Ramanujan Srinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar {Tamil}Tamil {Hindi}Hindi was born 22 December 1887 to a Tamil Brahmin Iyengar family in Erode. On a map of India, this is in a state now called Tamil Nadu. In 1887, Erode was in the Princely State of Mysore. To place this in context of what was happening in that region of the world, here are some events from that region in that time period:

      Risk Analysis for Software Projects Original: October 11th, 2022 Revised: August 2023
Introduction In regulated engineering, FMEAs, FTAs, and PRAs are common acronyms for risk management documents. Outside of that world, &ldquo;risk management&rdquo; is a bit of a snoozer of a topic. Behind this deceptive veneer lie some valuable tools that could benefit software projects at large, and not just in regulated environments.
One of these tools is the FMEA, or Failure Modes and Effects Analysis.

      Technical communications for a non-technical audience Date: August 1st, 2022
In every technical contributor&rsquo;s career, they will be required to communicate technical work to a non-technical audience. This task typically manifests itself in the form of e-mail, instant message, and one-on-one verbal communication. As they rise through the ranks, they will eventually present their work to larger groups and higher ranks, but the basic lay-person communication task remains the same.

      Think Slowly January 2024
I recently purchased a mechanical, ergonomic, and split keyboard1. I love the idea of yet another tech gadget to keep me engaged.
However, I quickly found myself in over my head. This keyboard is programmable, so the first thing I did was spend several hours tweaking the keys to my exact preference. I soon learned that key placement wouldn&rsquo;t solve my immediate problem - which was the drastic reduction in my typing speed.
