<p>It&rsquo;s not a good idea to maximize catching ideas.</p>
<p>The brain needs time to refresh itself. This is not meant to be a scientific claim by any means, merely a psychological observation. When an idea arrives, don&rsquo;t race to write it down. Chew on it for a while. Let it stew. Turn it into food for thought.</p>
<p>Even this particular idea right now - that ideas aren&rsquo;t precious - has been with me for some time. I only just figured out what the core thesis is.</p>
<p>Some symptoms that a person may be over-optimizing idea-catching:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Excessive proccess-ification of their daily life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An obsession over electronic tools for note-taking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vulnerability to burn-out</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, let ideas wash over you, like waves in an ocean. After a while, you&rsquo;ll start to see a pattern to things. Once the pattern is apparent, only then, try and pluck it from the water.</p>
