<p>First of all, I need to come up with a better name than Resume-Bot, it&rsquo;s just a placeholder for now.</p>
<p>Second - I really, really like this idea of an AI chatbot that knows my work history. I think I need to train the bot on a few pieces of information.
- First, the actual resume, I&rsquo;s just the written history of my schooling and career experience. It has to be all my report cards and grades, not just the ones I choose to highlight. I can also feed it my LinkedIn resume. So now it knows my concrete details.
- Second, I have to just start talking to it about me. It has to know how <em>I</em> personally think of myself. How I talk about myself. Fortunately, I write <del>too much</del> a lot, so I&rsquo;ll go find all those journal entries about my work and what I think of myself and feed that into the machine.</p>
<p>I think this project is cool for a number of other reasons. When I come up with big projects like this, my biggest downfall is going and researching if anyone else has done something similar, and then losing interest when I find out someone has. I should remember that this is unique because <em>I</em> am doing it, and not anyone else. So it will be unique in that there are no other chat bots of myself out there.</p>
<p>What am I creating? It&rsquo;s not just a way for me to try and automate my way out of a job interview. I&rsquo;m not sure if I even want that anyway.</p>
<p>In some way, I&rsquo;m creating a clone of myself. Almost like some sort of virtual horcrux, but it&rsquo;s not really evil. It&rsquo;s just like this strange copy of me that will float around the web forever. I can&rsquo;t take it back, not really. I guess I could shut it down, but that would never close the can of worms this opens.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know what the result of doing this weird project is. It probably will die into obscurity. Maybe I can get my 15 minutes of fame or whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to write more about the philosophical side of things once this is all said and done. At the very least this makes for interesting writing fodder.</p>
