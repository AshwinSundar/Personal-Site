<h1 id="the-automonk">The Automonk</h1>
<p>The <i>Automonk</i> patiently paced the hall, chanting
<font color="green">अमर प्रकाश, अंतर्ज्योति</font> in a muted manner that
failed to reverbate in the austere marble hall. The phrase, <i>Amar
Prakash, Antar Jyoti - Eternal Light, Inner Flame</i>, was derived from
analyzing thousands of religious texts and millions of hours of
ceremonies through a bespoke neural network designed for the
<i>Automonk</i>. Eyes closed, the hooded figure of brass and steel gave
the main hall of the monastery a cold, ascetic background noise. A
couple of small groups of devotees sat equidistantly apart, some
reverently conversing, others with eyes closed and prayer beads in hand.
The whine of the air conditioning was faintly audible, otherwise, no
other noise permeated the hall.</p>
<p>The <font color="green">Fall of Math</font> marked a significant
waypoint in the decline of humanity. The scientific surety of previous
generations was no longer guaranteed. Driven mad with uncertainty, most
researchers decided that computing models driven by artificial
intelligence were the only ways to make progress in a non-deterministic
universe. This strategy was wildly successful. Knowledge advanced
rapidly. With the help of artificial intelligence, decades of research
crystallized at a previously unimaginable pace. But then, humanity’s
cumulative knowledge reached an asymptote. Returns on research efforts
vastly diminished. Scientists became convinced that no more grand
unifying theories - hallmarks of previous centuries of scientific
discovery - were left to uncover. No one is certain why this happened.
The most popular theory is that artificial intelligence can only create
new knowledge and discoveries based on existing theories. Once existing
solution spaces were exhausted, new discovery became impossible.</p>
<p>The <i>Automonk</i> came about during the initial flurry of invention
following the Fall of Math. A philosophy professor, known by the
initials <i>HG</i>, constructed the robot after observing that the
vocation of priesthood had gone extinct sometime in the last century.
Unable to determine for certain why this occurred, <i>HG</i> instead
constructed several copies of their machine and distributed them to
various monasteries in an attempt to revive religion.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/automonk/automonk-1.png" width="600px" /></p>
<p>Trained on thousands of religious texts and millions of hours of
religious ceremonies, the <i>Automonk</i> attended to idols with
periodic ablutions, confidently paced the hall, and sat quietly, as
though meditating.</p>
<p><font color="green">अमर प्रकाश, अंतर्ज्योति</font><br>
<font color="green">अमर प्रकाश, अंतर्ज्योति</font><br>
<font color="green">अमर प्रकाश, अंतर्ज्योति</font><br></p>
<p><font color="gold">Pale sunlight</font> floods the hall. The gentle
whisper of a well-oiled door hinge is audible. A man enters the hall
uncertainly, a small pack draped across his shoulders. The
<i>Automonk</i>, unperturbed by design, continues:</p>
<p><font color="green">अमर प्रकाश, अंतर्ज्योति</font><br>
<font color="green">अमर प्रकाश, अंतर्ज्योति</font><br>
<font color="green">अमर प्रकाश, अंतर्ज्योति</font><br></p>
<p>The man sits cross-legged in a corner, away from fluorescent lights,
and quietly observes the proceedings. At a seemingly precise time, the
<i>Automonk</i> silently rises and proceeds to the altar. It performs
ablutions and begins chanting a new <i>sloka</i> more loudly. The
patrons shift their attention to the ceremony. The <i>Automonk</i> draws
a curtain around the deities and retires behind</i>. After a few
minutes, it folds away the curtains to reveal the freshly adorned
deities. It resumes pacing, this time changing mantras and accompanying
its recital with the jangle of small hand cymbals.</p>
<p>The man sits in the forgotten past. The past that was deemed
irrelevant by technology, discarded, and then forgotten entirely by
humanity. Religion was originally discredited and defeated by Science.
Yet the irony is that both have been cast away now, as ways of
understanding the universe. Both relics, misunderstandings of
Reality.</p>
