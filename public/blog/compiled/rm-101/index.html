<p>Original: October 11th, 2022 Revised: August 2023</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In regulated engineering, FMEAs, FTAs, and PRAs are common acronyms
for risk management documents. Outside of that world, “risk management”
is a bit of a snoozer of a topic. Behind this deceptive veneer lie some
valuable tools that could benefit software projects at large, and not
just in regulated environments.</p>
<p>One of these tools is the FMEA, or <strong>Failure Modes and Effects
Analysis</strong>. Before diving into the FMEA though, let’s set up a
little background information.</p>
<img src = '../assets/rm-101/Seinfeld-RM.png' style = 'display: block; margin: auto; width: 50%;'/>
<figcaption style="text-align: center">

</figcaption>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In the broader discipline of engineering, a failure can be defined as
an unintended consequence in a manufactured item. The manifestation of a
failure in software development is commonly known as a bug.</p>
<p>Here is a formalized definition of a bug:<br />
<em>Unexpected behavior in a deployed application as a result of code
that does not adequately cover all possible field use
conditions</em></p>
<p>In simpler terms:<br />
<em>Code that doesn’t behave the way it was designed</em></p>
<p>Some bugs are immediately obvious and can be fixed in the moment.
Others only manifest themselves in the field or in a production
environment. The cost of fixing a bug grows <a
href="https://deepsource.io/blog/exponential-cost-of-fixing-bugs/">exponentially</a>
from the time it is created all the way to field deployment. This means
the cost to fix a bug in code as soon as one writes the code is very
minimal. This is compared to noticing it when the code base is more
mature, core engineers have left the project, and eventually the product
is deployed to the field and might require a recall. Depending on the
software, one might be able to deploy an over-the-air patch, but in
critical embedded systems this may not be an option.</p>

<h3 id="just-eliminate-risk">“Just eliminate risk!”</h3>
<p>This is extremely concerning to most managers. These situations may
be handled with the following phrases:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>By attaining 100% test coverage, we will eliminate risk from
this project.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>When we can guarantee 99.9999% uptime, we can safely assume
that failure will never happen.</em></p></li>
<li><p>And a personal favorite: <em>Just eliminate risk!</em></p></li>
</ul>
<img src = '../assets/rm-101/Office-Nonsense.png' style = 'display: block; margin: auto; width: 100%;'/>
<figcaption style="text-align: center">
<em>“A.A.R.M.”, The Office (2013)</em>
</figcaption>
<p>With a bold statement like that, context matters. The gold standard
in highly regulated industries is 6 nines - or 99.9999% reliability.
This corresponds to approximate <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma#Sigma_levels">3.4 defects
per million opportunities of failure</a>.</p>
<p><strong>It is a logical fallacy to state that risk can be
eliminated.</strong> Unless one works in first principles where
<strong>MAYBE</strong> certain behaviors can be guaranteed, one cannot
and should not guarantee that the product, whether that be software or
hardware, will never fail. The likelihood of failure might range from
common to astronomically rare, but it always exists. For this article,
the definition of failure has been left rather broad. In a future
article, we’ll explore failures with a range of effects, from minimal to
catastrophic.</p>
<p><strong>The goal of risk management is to minimize, not eliminate,
risk in a technical project by minimizing the probability of failure and
minimizing the impact of failure.</strong></p>
<h3 id="how">How?</h3>
<p>How can risk be minimized effectively? There have been books written
about the subject, software tools developed, and an entire risk
management consulting industry dedicated to aerospace, medical device,
and pharmaceutical risk management. One of the core tools used by every
company in these industries is called the FMEA.</p>
<h2 id="the-fmea">The FMEA</h2>
<p>The Failure Modes and Effects Analysis, or FMEA, explains how
failures at a component level propagate to system failures. This
document can get massively complex for large system with many subsystems
and components, such as an airplane.</p>
<p>So what’s the motivation? Why go to all this effort to analyze a
manufactured product from a risk perspective? A good FMEA tells a good
story, and it does so in two key ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The FMEA tells a top-down story to regulatory bodies</li>
<li>The FMEA allows engineers to tell a bottom-up story</li>
</ul>
<p>When a regulated device fails, the manufacturer has to explain to the
regulatory body WHY it failed, and how they will fix it in the future.
This is the top-down story. The FDA and FAA are examples of regulated
bodies. All they know is that the device failed at the user level, and
it’s up to the manufacturer to guide them into the details of the
device, identify the root cause of the failure, and fix it.</p>
<p><img src = '../assets/rm-101/Component-System-Failures.png' style = 'display: block; margin: auto; width: 75%;'/></p>
<p>If a manufacturer is unable to provide a resolution, the device can
be pulled from the market, either voluntarily by the manufacturer or as
mandated by a regulatory body. A recent high-profile instance of this
was the Boeing 737 MAX, which experienced a software failure in a
program called MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System)
and ultimately caused 2 <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneuvering_Characteristics_Augmentation_System">fatal
accidents</a>.</p>
<h2 id="an-example">An Example</h2>
<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p>Airplanes and medical devices are very complicated systems, so let’s
use an example everyone is familiar with - a bicycle. Let’s pretend that
we want to get into the road bike space. Our task as engineers is to
build a bicycle that is fast and safe. After all, if we want to sell our
bike, we need to both convince customers that it’s fast enough to win
races, and safe enough to meet the minimum requirements imposed by the
FBA (Federal Bicycle Administration), an imaginary entity that allows
manufacturers to sell bicycles in the United States.</p>
<p><img src = '../assets/rm-101/Bicycle-Components.png' style = 'display: block; margin: auto; width: 100%;'/></p>
<h3 id="components-and-functions">Components and Functions</h3>
<p>The first step is to define the system architecture. Let’s call this
grouping of top-level entities <strong>Components</strong>. On our
bicycle I’ll keep things simple and only analyze the
<em>Drivetrain</em>, <em>Brakes</em>, and <em>Frame</em> for this
example. Of course there are many other subsystems we could define and
analyze as well, and we could even slice-and-dice the bike architecture
in a different way depending on the goals of our analysis.</p>
<p>Some important questions to answer include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What is the boundary of analysis for each component?</em> This
means, what sub-components of the bicycle are members of the drivetrain,
which are components of the brake, and which are components of the
frame?</li>
<li><em>What are the functions of each component?</em> What are some
primary and secondary purposes of the drivetrain, the brakes, and the
frame?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s build an actual FMEA for our bicycle. The primary function of
the drivetrain is to move the bicycle forwards. In engineering terms we
can state this as <em>Converting rotational motion into horizontal
motion</em>. The primary function of the brakes is to bring the bicycle
to a stop, which we can state as <em>Converting kinetic energy into
heat</em>. Finally, the frame has two functions: <em>Supporting the
cyclist</em> and <em>Supporting the components of the bicycle</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p><span
style="color: green; font-size: 32px;"><strong>Component:</strong>

style="color: blue"><strong>Function:</strong> Support the components of
the bicycle</span><br></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="failure-modes">Failure Modes</h3>
<p>Ok great! So now that we have defined some components and each of
their functions, let’s take a look at how these components can fail. (As
a little sneak peak, we will be able to recursively define each
subsequent level of analysis. In a later example, we will consider the
Drivetrain as its own system, identify its Components, and so on.)</p>
<p>A convenient and standard way to define how a component might fail is
by writing the Failure Mode as an anti-function. Generally, this would
be written something like:</p>
<p>The <em>Component</em> fails to <em>deliver the function</em>.</p>
<p>For our drivetrain, we would say that <em>the Drivetrain fails to
convert rotational motion into horizontal motion</em>. This might seem
pretty obvious and redundant, but simple verbiage like this keeps things
consistent across our risk analysis. This allows us to focus on why
things are failing, and how to mitigate those failures.</p>
<p>Let’s use this same template to come up with failure modes for the
Brakes and Frame. A way that our brakes can fail is by <em>failing to
convert kinetic energy into heat</em>. Since our frame has two
functions, we can write two failure modes, one for each function -
<em>Frame fails to support cyclist</em>, and <em>Frame fails to support
components</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p><span

<p><span

<span><strong>Function:</strong> Support the components of the
bicycle</span><br> <span
style="color: blue; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Failure Mode:</strong>
Frame fails to support components</span><br></p>
<hr />
<p>Great! We’ve come up with a bunch of ways that our bike can fail. But
are these the only ways these components can fail? Of course not! There
are a wide variety of ways anything can fail, and not just
catastrophically as we seem to have defined here.</p>
<p>As a reminder, a failure mode is defined as <em>the manner in which a
component fails to meet or deliver its intended function</em>. According
to risk management theory, there are <a
href="https://www.elsevier.com/books/safety-risk-management-for-medical-devices/elahi/978-0-323-85755-0">6
main ways</a> most components can fail. The component:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has no ability to perform the function</li>
<li>Delivers only part of the function</li>
<li>Delivers excessive function</li>
<li>Delivers intermittent function</li>
<li>Delivers a degraded function</li>
<li>Delivers function at the wrong time</li>
</ul>
<p>Armed with this new information, let’s head back to our risk
analysis. I think total brake failure is an important consideration, but
not the only way our bicycle can fail to stop. Partial brake failure is
pretty common and can be just as dangerous, so let’s incorporate that
into our analysis.</p>
<hr />
<p><span

<span style="color: red; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Failure

<span><strong>Function:</strong> Support the components of the
bicycle</span><br> <span style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Failure

<hr />
<p>I’ve updated our existing failure mode to reflect total brake
failure, and I’ve created a new one called <em>Brakes PARTIALLY fail to
convert kinetic energy into heat.</em> We’ll find that when it comes
time to mitigate these risks, we can address each individually with some
specific mitigation plans.</p>
<hr />
<p>Whew! We’ve gone through a lot so far, so let’s take a breather and
let some of this sink in.</p>
<p>The reason we’re doing this analysis is to understand the risk
profile of a bicycle more thoroughly. We are pretending that we are the
manufacturer of the bicycle, and we need to first and foremost
demonstrate that our bicycle is safe to operate in its intended use
conditions. As competent mechanical engineers in the field of bicycle
manufacturing, we will always strive to design a safe bicycle. As part
of our competency, we need to understand which components of the bicycle
have the highest likelihood of failing, and what the impacts of their
failure are. So we do this kind of risk analysis to create an accurate
risk profile and potentially introduce mitigation plans if we discover
that a component introduces unacceptable levels of failure.</p>
<h3 id="causality">Causality</h3>
<p>The next step is to determine causality. Why are these failures
occurring? In the real world you might systematically determine
causality by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determining the design deficiency that results in the failure
mode</li>
<li>Determining a manufacturing process deficiency</li>
<li>Determining a user’s failure to perform a task</li>
</ul>
<p>These 3 span a wide variety of potential root causes, and it’s common
to separate out an FMEA into design FMEAs, process FMEAs, and use case
FMEAs in order to organize the risk analysis better. For our example,
we’ll only focus on design deficiencies.</p>
<p><img src = '../assets/rm-101/FMEAs.png' style = 'display: block; margin: auto; width: 100%;'/></p>
<p>Let’s identify some causes of failure. A reason the drivetrain might
fail to convert rotational motion into horizontal motion is because the
<em>pedals detach</em>. Brake failure might occur because the <em>brake
cable snaps</em>, or the <em>brake disc overheats</em>. Finally, the
frame may fail because the <em>seat tube or head tube detaches</em>.</p>

<hr />
<h3 id="effects-of-failure">Effects of Failure</h3>
<p>We’re almost there! The last step is to identify the
<strong>effect</strong> of each of our failure modes. These failure
modes are once again written generically, because once we get deeper
into this analysis, we will want to make it easy to connect multiple
failure modes to the same end effect. This will allow us to make
interesting insights at the end of the analysis about how many end
effects are the results of certain types of failures.</p>
<p>For now though, for the drivetrain component, the effect of being
unable to convert rotational motion into horizontal motion is that the
<em>cyclist cannot accelerate the bicycle</em>.</p>
<p>For the brakes, the effect of being unable to completely convert
kinetic energy into heat is that the <em>cyclist cannot decelerate the
bicycle</em>. The effect of only being able to partially convert kinetic
energy into heat is that the <em>cyclist’s ability to the decelerate the
bicycle is reduced</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, for the frame, the effect of being unable to support the
cyclist is that the <em>cyclist falls from the bicycle</em>. The effect
of being unable to support the components is that the <em>components
detach from the bicycle</em>.</p>

<p>We made it! Great job for sticking through that. We slogged our way
through a system DFMEA and made a pretty basic, but useful framework to
run with and expand upon. Before we wrap up, let’s take a look at a
completed subsystem DFMEA so we can see how it has its own recursive
definition of all these elements as well. We will focus on the
<em>Pedals</em> sub-component here.</p>

<p>Recall that a good FMEA should tell a good story. In this case, the
story being told is that we have a sub-component called the pedals,
whose primary function is toc translate the force of the legs pushing
down on them into rotational motion in the crankset. One way this
function can fail to occur is if the pedal detaches from its mounting
point on the crank arm. A reason this might occur is because of
precession, which is a phenomenon by which rotational motion causes a
screwed object to unscrew itself from its mounting point. Fortunately, a
very simple way to prevent this from occuring is to reverse-thread one
of the pedal mounts. That way, when the cyclist pedals, they tighten the
pedal against the crank arm, as opposed to loosening it.</p>
<p>Of course this is just an example, and any competent bike
manufacturer will include this feature from the start. But we’re new to
bike manufacturing and learning along the way! Good thing we did some
risk analysis to figure this out ahead of time.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>With this exercise, we have developed a rudimentary FMEA, but more
importantly we have developed <em>a framework to think about any
engineering project in terms of risk</em>. This can be a very powerful
tool especially in software.</p>
<p>Remember that your code base often contains a LOT of code that no one
on your team wrote. This can be in the form of NPM modules or other
ecosystem dependencies. In the biz, this is sometimes called Software of
Unknown Provenance, or <strong>SOUP</strong>. It’s just as important to
understand what’s in the SOUP as it is to understand what’s in your own
code.</p>
<p>A great interface document for understanding what’s in the SOUP that
might make you sick is an FMEA made by the provisioner of the SOUP. When
that’s not available, or another equivalent that describes potential
failure points in the code, then you really ought to be checking out
what’s in those dependencies to make sure you’re not introducing unknown
amounts of risk into your project. It is common for dependency
developers to provide an automated test suite, which is helpful to study
in order to identify any blindspots in their testing that might impact
the behavior of your program.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>
<p>Now that we have created a rudimentary FMEA, what’s next?</p>
<ul>
<li>We should introduce a mathematical framework that allows us to
compute probabilities of failure and severities of effects.</li>
<li>We should also organize our efforts to burn down risk by focusing on
components with the highest probabilities of failure and/or severities
of effects</li>
</ul>
<p>By introducing some math, we can start to visualize our risk burndown
in much more interesting ways.</p>
<p><img src = '../assets/rm-101/sankey-unweighted.svg' style = 'display: block; margin: auto; width: 100%;'/></p>
<p>For example, here is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram">Sankey diagram</a> I
created. This type of chart is called a flow diagram, where the width of
each connection represents a vaguely-defined “riskiness” measure that
I’ve just made up. You could think of this as some sort of product of
<code>probability of failure</code> x <code>severity of failure</code>,
broken down by component. In this naive example, I’m assuming that every
component contributes equally to this made-up “riskiness” measure.</p>
<p><img src = '../assets/rm-101/sankey-weighted.svg' style = 'display: block; margin: auto; width: 100%;'/></p>
<p>But by creating a mathematical framework for our components to
interact with, we can start to come up with a more interesting diagram.
This diagram can now tell us which particular components and
sub-components contribute the most to our overall risk profile. With
this information, we can decide where our efforts are best directed in
order to reduce the overall risk profile of the project.</p>
<p>For example, here at Ashwin Bicycle Industries, we <em>know</em> what
we’re doing when it comes to drivetrains and brakes. That’s old hat to
us. But bicycle <em>frames</em>? That’s new, and difficult. There’s a
lot of risk involved in our current techniques. So we have some extra
work to do to burn down the risk associated with our brittle bicycle
frames.</p>
<p>And we can clearly see that in the above diagram! The bicycle frame
component has an overall risk value of 150, representing nearly half of
the risk associated with our bike in total. Program managers can use
this information to better allocate some extra resources to the parts of
the project with the most risk.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Understanding the full risk profile of your project can be extremely
lengthy. In regulated industries there are entire groups dedicated to
this single task. Depending on the type of development you’re doing,
it’s probably not necessary to construct an FMEA for <em>every</em>
single component of your project.</p>
<p>Perhaps on the next project you start, you could take some time up
front to identify a few critical components of your application that
might benefit from risk analysis. You’ll probably find that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You understand your code base in more detail than before</li>
<li>You’re able to communicate how long a bug fix might take with more
accuracy</li>
<li>You’re able to identify future issues before they manifest
themselves in a production environment</li>
</ul>
