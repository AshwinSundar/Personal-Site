<p>Date: August 1st, 2022</p>
<p>The original version of this website was written using GatsbyJS, a
headless CMS engine that’s all the rage right now in the world of web
development. After a few weeks, I learned that it was tremendously
overkill for a personal website with maybe a few dozen pages (including
all my blog posts). Most importantly though, GatsbyJS is bloated with
dependencies that take forever for me troubleshoot when all I want to do
is add support for MathML.</p>
<p>The zipped, compressed, ready-to-deploy GatsbyJS package is 18.6
MEGABYTES. For a couple dozen pages. It’s nuts. I’m a little scared of
looking at how big the uncompressed source code is…<em>waiting for Mac
Finder to calculate size</em>…1.03 GIGABYTES for 62 THOUSAND items???
Are you kidding me??? How many NPM modules do I need to run this tiny
site???</p>
<p>I got fed up with learning what I consider non-value-add information
about a fad-ish website-building engine, and decided to go back to
basics.</p>
<p>I threw it all away. I got a bit overzealous, and threw away
Javascript too. That’s right - this site is written entirely in HTML and
CSS. That’s it. This decision was driven partially about seeking the
most minimal toolset possible (which I believe I have achieved), and
also by my disdain for the anti-intellectual patterns present in
Javascript and the community. But who knows, maybe I’ll bring back
Javascript. Or maybe I’ll hook this site up to Rust + WebAssembly, a
side project I’ve wanted to pursue for a while now anyways.</p>
<p>I also plan to working in software development for a while, and will
likely own this website for decades of my working lifetime. I want
something that’s future-proof. I can guarantee that exactly 0 of the
popular frameworks today will be popular (or even exist) in 10-20 years.
Who knows what will be popular then. I don’t care, to be honest. And I
don’t have to, because HTML and CSS are here forever.</p>
<p>Update: August 26th, 2022 After a couple of weeks of working on other
projects, I revisited my personal site to write a new blog post. And WOW
it just felt second-nature to enter the code base and figure out what to
do, even though I had completely forgotten about the architecture I
built (2 weeks is a long time in my head). When I build stuff from the
ground up, I always am wary of my poor free recall ability, and leave
myself breadcrumbs as I work on things. In the case of this site, I left
PLENTY of breadcrumbs, so it was a breeze to pick things up and keep
working.</p>
<p>I contrast this with using GatsbyJS, which was I built this site on
originally before tearing it down to the ground. Granted, this might be
true for any framework that I’m somewhat green to. Which is pretty much
every framework, because web development just doesn’t stop changing.</p>
<p>As a multidisciplinary software engineer I’m not always working in
the same field. At my first job I was working in infrastructure tooling
at a medical device company. In my current job I’m a consultant who gets
move around projects every 6 months or so. I started out on a web
development project, but now I’m in an embedded project, which means I’m
not going to keep up with the web dev world for several months at least.
Things will definitely change in that time, because that’s just the
nature of the twitchy field.</p>
<p>Anyway I’m a minimalist developer so I get the most pride out of
removing unnecessary code, more so than writing new code.</p>
