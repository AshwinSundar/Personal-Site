<h1 id="resume-bot">Resume-Bot</h1>
<p>Date: December 1st, 2022</p>
<p>First of all, I need to come up with a better name than Resume-Bot,
it’s just a placeholder for now.</p>
<p>Second - I really, really like this idea of an AI chatbot that knows
my work history. I think I need to train the bot on a few pieces of
information. - First, the actual resume, I’s just the written history of
my schooling and career experience. It has to be all my report cards and
grades, not just the ones I choose to highlight. I can also feed it my
LinkedIn resume. So now it knows my concrete details. - Second, I have
to just start talking to it about me. It has to know how <em>I</em>
personally think of myself. How I talk about myself. Fortunately, I
write <del>too much</del> a lot, so I’ll go find all those journal
entries about my work and what I think of myself and feed that into the
machine.</p>
<p>I think this project is cool for a number of other reasons. When I
come up with big projects like this, my biggest downfall is going and
researching if anyone else has done something similar, and then losing
interest when I find out someone has. I should remember that this is
unique because <em>I</em> am doing it, and not anyone else. So it will
be unique in that there are no other chat bots of myself out there.</p>
<p>What am I creating? It’s not just a way for me to try and automate my
way out of a job interview. I’m not sure if I even want that anyway.</p>
<p>In some way, I’m creating a clone of myself. Almost like some sort of
virtual horcrux, but it’s not really evil. It’s just like this strange
copy of me that will float around the web forever. I can’t take it back,
not really. I guess I could shut it down, but that would never close the
can of worms this opens.</p>
<p>I don’t really know what the result of doing this weird project is.
It probably will die into obscurity. Maybe I can get my 15 minutes of
fame or whatever.</p>
<p>I’d like to write more about the philosophical side of things once
this is all said and done. At the very least this makes for interesting
writing fodder.</p>
