<h1 id="quiet-quitting-linkedin">Quiet-quitting LinkedIn</h1>
<p>December 2023</p>
<p>I will be deleting my LinkedIn profile at the end of this year. For
many years, this site served its purpose of keeping me connected with
colleagues and mentors. However, the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">decay of the
platform</a> over the last couple of years has made it such that I no
longer wish to participate.</p>
<p>What began as a resume-builder and jobs board has turned into a
full-fledged social media website, with all the negative externalities
that entails. Features such as the news feed, recommendations, and
community-curated articles enable algorithmic bias, extend surveillance
capitalism, and spread misinformation. Disturbingly, LinkedIn
annihilates the idea of meritocracy in the workplace, and instead
promotes people who are good at posting to social media.</p>
<img title = "Office Space flair" alt = "Office Space flair" src = "/blog/assets/quit-linkedin/office-space-flair.jpg">
<figcaption style="text-align: center;">
Pins might have been better
</figcaption>
<p>Accumulating “recommendations” and “endorsements” are how one
accumulates flair. Tactics like timing posts such that colleagues see it
during their lunch break or on the way home is the newest form of
soft-power in the workplace. Carefully crafted posts that parrot one’s
employer’s media guidelines are how one builds clout. Writing in passive
voice and third-person about topics, in a vague and circumspect manner,
with strange punctuation, is how one gets “reactions” - the social
currency of LinkedIn<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>No one cares about a LinkedIn poster’s vapid, uninformed opinions on
domestic or world affairs. Repeating a company’s social mantras doesn’t
make someone a good person. It makes them a corporate shill. They are
polluting everyone else’s minds with corporate propaganda.</p>
<p>In the office, most people are reluctant to speak about political
affairs. In my opinion, this is appropriate - we are there to work, not
chat about irrelevant politics. But surfing LinkedIn isn’t work - it’s
work-adjacent, with a splash of networking. The top LinkedIn influencers
(Linkfluencers?) spend inordinate amounts of time curating their
LinkedIn persona and crafting ornate opinions on topics they know
nothing about.</p>
<img title = "LinkedIn Influencer a.k.a. 'Linkfluencer'" alt = "LinkedIn Influencer a.k.a. 'Linkfluencer'" src = "/blog/assets/quit-linkedin/linkfluencer.png">
<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
<figcaption style="text-align: center;">
People paid to professionally post to LinkedIn. How pathetic.
</figcaption>
<p>The worst part is, all of these opinions align with whatever their
respective company wants them to say. The result is that opinions on
LinkedIn are a corporatocracy of ideas. No one with an original or
interesting idea will ever share it on LinkedIn. This site represents
all of the things I have come to despise about corporate culture.</p>
<p>LinkedIn is the last piece of rent-seeking social media that I use.
It feels appropriate to delete my profile and end reliance on social
media altogether. I have other plans that I believe will more than
compensate for the lack of visibility on the most popular jobs
board.</p>
<p>I am fortunate to work in a field where completed work matters more
than talk. It is more productive for me to focus on personal projects,
and detail them on my personal website {link to some of your side
projects}.</p>
<p>With this website, I seek to fulfill the dream of Web 1.0 - freedom
of expression, democratization of information, and creative exploration.
Through my personal site, I am free to explore any technical or
non-technical (links to each) topic that I desire.</p>
<p>So with that, goodbye LinkedIn! Thanks for the dozens of recruiter
emails that inquire if I would like to work in a totally unrelated field
for two-thirds of my current salary. Thanks for infusing my mornings
with unintelligent technical discussions about Artificial Intelligence.
Thanks for inviting me to “collaborative articles”, which surely are
some way to train Microsoft’s evil AI machine.</p>

<p>Original post to LinkedIn for posteriority:</p>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I will be deleting my LinkedIn profile at the end of this year. This
site has served its purpose of keeping me connected with colleagues and
mentors. However, the decay of the platform
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification) over the last couple of
years has made it such that I no longer wish to participate in this
corporatocracy of ideas. Feel free to read my full thoughts [here].</p>
<p>Say hi at hi@ashwinsundar.com!</p>
<p>Happy holidays! Stay sane!</p>
