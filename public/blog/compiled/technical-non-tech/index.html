<h1 id="technical-communications-for-a-non-technical-audience">Technical
communications for a non-technical audience</h1>
<p>Date: August 1st, 2022</p>
<p>In every technical contributor’s career, they will be required to
communicate technical work to a non-technical audience. This task
typically manifests itself in the form of e-mail, instant message, and
one-on-one verbal communication. As they rise through the ranks, they
will eventually present their work to larger groups and higher ranks,
but the basic lay-person communication task remains the same.</p>
<p>Throughout their career, every technical contributor (TC) will be
required to summarized complicated details for a non-technical audience.
Here `are some tips for how to successfully approach these
interactions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Don’t overexplain.</strong></p>
<p>Technical employees have to juggle a lot of puzzle pieces in their
head at once. A comic by engineer Jason Heeris illustrates this:</p>
<p><img src="https://heeris.id.au/trinkets/ProgrammerInterrupted.png" style = 'display: block; margin: auto; width: 75%;' /></p>
<figcaption style="text-align: center">
<p><a href = 'https://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/'>Don’t
interrupt a programmer</a></p>
</figcaption>
<p>The web of complexity that technical employees have to unravel in
code that they wrote can be remarkable. And for that reason, when a
non-technical colleague or client has questions about what we are
working on or why they are experiencing a particular issue, we have a
tendency to overexplain everything that we understand in all matters
related to and adjacent to the problem.</p>
<p>This can be overwhelming for even your technical colleagues, when
they lack the context and expertise that you might have in a corner of
the codebase. It’s usually better to share a high-level overview of what
the problem is and how you’re attempting to solve it, and then let your
colleague choose the questions they wish to ask (if any). This is more
efficient for everyone involved, and it’s easier for your colleague to
digest the information they need to know. Your colleagues, technical and
non-technical, can then explain what you’re working on to someone else
more clearly, as opposed to saying “I don’t really know what they’re
working on…why don’t you go ask Bobitha?”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don’t patronize.</strong></p>
<p>On the other extreme, you don’t need to patronize your audience by
dumbing down what you’re doing. Explaining that Javascript is full of
magic fairies that like to randomly zap variables and change how they
behave is a crappy way of explaining that Javascript is a weakly-typed
language and you don’t fully understand implicit coercions yet. One
thing I like to do when explaining a subject to someone who isn’t
familiar is to compare and contrast multiple examples:</p>
<p><em>Javascript is weakly-typed, which means that the language has
certain pre-defined assumptions that don’t always behave the way you
expect, whereas C is more strongly typed and can behave more predictably
in the same situations. Finally, all languages exist on a spectrum of
weak-to-strong typing, with various advantages and disadvantages on both
sides of the spectrum.</em></p>
<p>There! You successfully communicated a complex topic to a
non-technical audience in a way that they can digest and regurgitate as
needed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do be in control of the conversation</strong></p>
<p>When you’re deep in a project, you often have an internal map of the
trajectories that a project can take. Knowns and unknowns both reside in
this map, and it’s the unknowns that can land you in trouble. It’s
helpful to take a probabilistic approach to assessing uncertain
situations. For example, on a recent project, I discovered an issue with
an interface between two software systems made by two different vendors.
When I contacted both vendors for a solution, they each pointed the
finger at the other. Rather than communicate this confusing and
frustrating turn of events directly to the client, I assessed the
situation and determined that either one of two outcomes was likely:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Vendor A was responsible for the issue and therefore, for coming
up with a solution</p></li>
<li><p>Vendor B was responsible for the issue and therefore, for coming
up with a solution</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I needed to provide an update today, and didn’t have time for further
research to determine which vendor was responsible. Instead, I
recognized that vendor B had been responsible historically for several
other bugs in our project. I communicated that due to our past
experience, we believed Vendor B was responsible for the issue our
client was currently facing. While I need to do more research to
determine the root cause, we would follow up with the vendor
shortly.</p>
<p>That’s a nice, succinct communication to our non-technical client!
They were unlikely to care about the nuances of request payloads and how
I <em>think</em> Vendor B was producing an incorrect payload that Vendor
A was unable to process, but wasn’t totally sure yet. For this audience,
this explanation would confuse more than illuminate - it would be
information overload for them.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>================================================================</p>
<p>In conclusion, there is an art to effective non-technical
communications. It is a soft skilll that every technical contributor
should sharpen for their arsenal arsenal. Every audience is different,
so try out each of these tactics, gauge the response of your audience,
and tailor your communications appropriately so that you don’t have to
repeat yourself and you leave your audience happy with the information
you provided.</p>
<p>I’ll leave you all with this humorous sketch:</p>
