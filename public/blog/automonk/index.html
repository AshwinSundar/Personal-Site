<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Automonk<!-- raw HTML omitted --> patiently paced the hall, chanting
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->अमर प्रकाश, अंतर्ज्योति<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
in a muted manner that failed to reverbate in the austere marble hall. The phrase, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amar Prakash, Antar Jyoti - Eternal Light, Inner Flame<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, was derived from analyzing thousands of religious texts and millions of hours of ceremonies through a bespoke neural network designed for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Automonk<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Eyes closed, the hooded figure of brass and steel gave the main hall of the monastery a cold, ascetic background noise. A couple of small groups of devotees sat equidistantly apart, some reverently conversing, others with eyes closed and prayer beads in hand. The whine of the air conditioning was faintly audible, otherwise, no other noise permeated the hall.</p>
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fall of Math<!-- raw HTML omitted --> marked a significant waypoint in the decline of humanity. The scientific surety of previous generations was no longer guaranteed. Driven mad with uncertainty, most researchers decided that computing models driven by artificial intelligence were the only ways to make progress in a non-deterministic universe. This strategy was wildly successful. Knowledge advanced rapidly. With the help of artificial intelligence, decades of research crystallized at a previously unimaginable pace. But then, humanity&rsquo;s cumulative knowledge reached an asymptote. Returns on research efforts vastly diminished. Scientists became convinced that no more grand unifying theories - hallmarks of previous centuries of scientific discovery - were left to uncover. No one is certain why this happened. The most popular theory is that artificial intelligence can only create new knowledge and discoveries based on existing theories. Once existing solution spaces were exhausted, new discovery became impossible.</p>
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Automonk<!-- raw HTML omitted --> came about during the initial flurry of invention following the Fall of Math. A philosophy professor, known by the initials <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HG<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, constructed the robot after observing that the vocation of priesthood had gone extinct sometime in the last century. Unable to determine for certain why this occurred, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HG<!-- raw HTML omitted --> instead constructed several copies of their machine and distributed them to various monasteries in an attempt to revive religion.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Trained on thousands of religious texts and millions of hours of religious ceremonies, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Automonk<!-- raw HTML omitted --> attended to idols with periodic ablutions, confidently paced the hall, and sat quietly, as though meditating.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->अमर प्रकाश, अंतर्ज्योति<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->अमर प्रकाश, अंतर्ज्योति<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->अमर प्रकाश, अंतर्ज्योति<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pale sunlight<!-- raw HTML omitted --> floods the hall. The gentle whisper of a well-oiled door hinge is audible. A man enters the hall uncertainly, a small pack draped across his shoulders. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Automonk<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, unperturbed by design, continues:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->अमर प्रकाश, अंतर्ज्योति<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->अमर प्रकाश, अंतर्ज्योति<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->अमर प्रकाश, अंतर्ज्योति<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The man sits cross-legged in a corner, away from fluorescent lights, and quietly observes the proceedings. At a seemingly precise time, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Automonk<!-- raw HTML omitted --> silently rises and proceeds to the altar. It performs ablutions and begins chanting a new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sloka<!-- raw HTML omitted --> more loudly. The patrons shift their attention to the ceremony. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Automonk<!-- raw HTML omitted --> draws a curtain around the deities and retires behind<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. After a few minutes, it folds away the curtains to reveal the freshly adorned deities. It resumes pacing, this time changing mantras and accompanying its recital with the jangle of small hand cymbals.</p>
<p>The man sits in the forgotten past. The past that was deemed irrelevant by technology, discarded, and then forgotten entirely by humanity. Religion was originally discredited and defeated by Science. Yet the irony is that both have been cast away now, as ways of understanding the universe. Both relics, misunderstandings of Reality.</p>
