mermaid.js - Excellent tool for creating architecture (and other) diagrams from text. Add to a markdown file with special syntax. Renders in GitHub natively. Has some bugs, but team seems to have a good head on its shoulders and should hopefully work them out soon. 8/10
VSCode - One of the few things Microsoft hasn&rsquo;t totally screwed up yet.

I am attempting to solve a homework problem that asks me to write a helper function to use in a later problem. I have gotten 95% of the way there with this function, written in Standard ML:
fun longest_string_helper f sl = foldl (fn (next, acc) =&gt; if f (next, acc) then acc else next) &#34;&#34; sl The purpose of this function is to take a function f and apply something called a left fold across each element of the list sl.

    auto versus type inference April 2023
Question: Do let in Typescript and auto in C++ behave the same way as Standard MLs optional type annotations?
auto x = {expr} is an example of a &ldquo;placeholder type&rdquo; specifier. According to cppreference.com, this specifies that the type of the variable that is being declared will be automatically deduced from its initializer..
How is the type deduced? Using template argument deduction, which is a fancy concept for describing &ldquo;solving an equation&rdquo; in math.

    Stop Trying to Catch Ideas It&rsquo;s not a good idea to maximize catching ideas.
The brain needs time to refresh itself. This is not meant to be a scientific claim by any means, merely a psychological observation. When an idea arrives, don&rsquo;t race to write it down. Chew on it for a while. Let it stew. Turn it into food for thought.
Even this particular idea right now - that ideas aren&rsquo;t precious - has been with me for some time.

    Benchmarking Rust code using Criterion.rs Date: June 14th, 2022
Introduction Benchmarking is a method of systematically assessing a program for performance. This process is a valuable component of regression testing because it helps you compare changes and improvements to your code. The systems programming language Rust offers many statistically rigorous analysis techniques, such as the Criterion crate, which is a popular tool used for benchmarking in Rust. In this article, we&rsquo;ll go into more detail on how to use Criterion to compare various Rust functions to solve a problem from Project Euler.

    Django Front-End &ldquo;Front-end&rdquo; in web development refers to the visual appearance of an application or website. In Django, a web development framework, the front-end is created in DTL (Django Template Language), which is a superset of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).
DTL represents the &ldquo;what&rdquo; of the page - the actual contents. The &ldquo;how&rdquo; of the page - how the page appears - is defined by CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).

In late July 2022, I began reading an excellent book called Ideas that Created the Future - Classic Papers of Computer Science by Harry R. Lewis. As I began exploring theoretical computer science in more detail, I immediately sought out &ldquo;review&rdquo; papers, which I recalled from grad school often provide a great overview of a particular subfield. These papers can be a bit lengthy, but the content is generally pretty digestible compared to culiminating work of a thesis, for example.

    Introduction to Indian Philosophy Preamble Thinking, writing, and speaking about any ancient culture using modern English is extremely challenging. A great deal is lost in translation. Many religions, including Hinduism, strongly encourage the study of the religion in the original language. As a child, I learned Hindu slokas in Sanskrit, with only a tenuous understanding of what the phrases meant.
As a result, I am always hesistant to attempt to describe theories of Bharathiya Darshan, or Indian Philosophy, in English.

In that class, we were shown many things. Variables! Inputs and outputs! Roman numerals! Classes! As a neuroscience major, I hadn&rsquo;t the faintest clue what the point of any of this was.

Most importantly though, GatsbyJS is bloated with dependencies that take forever for me troubleshoot when all I want to do is add support for MathML.

    Parallel Processing in Rust Date: April 6th, 2022
Rust is a systems programming language that is quickly gaining traction at well-known companies including Amazon, Discord, Dropbox, Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft. It is built for performance, reliability, and productivity and has been voted the most loved programming language according to Stack Overflow&rsquo;s Annual Developer Survey since 2016. Some large-scale commercial projects that have been built using Rust include:
Mozilla&rsquo;s Servo parallel browser engine Discord&rsquo;s Read States service Polkadot&rsquo;s Substrate blockchain engine Figma&rsquo;s Multiplayer service All of these real-world use cases of Rust utilize and benefit from concurrent and parallel processing, which can be daunting to implement on a good day, and pretty terrifying when implemented badly.

    Programming is Engineering
April 2023
Some people say that computer science isn&rsquo;t engineering. They&rsquo;re right. Computer science is the field of first principles, much like physics and chemistry are to mechanical engineering and chemical engineering. Computer science itself is an abstraction layer to another field - mathematics. Depending on what one works on, they may be closer on the spectrum to &ldquo;applied mathematics&rdquo; than &ldquo;computer science&rdquo;.
This is true for other engineering fields as well.

    Programming Languages Date: October 2022
I recently began a Coursera course called &ldquo;Programming Languages&rdquo;, offered by Dan Grossman at the University of Washington. I decided to take this course because the description advertises it as a way to understand the underpinning of all programming languages more thoroughly. When I first learned to program on my own, I always assumed that once I had more experience and learned more languages, I would began to understand the commonalities and differences between programming languages, and that would be sufficient.

In every technical contributor&rsquo;s career, they will be required to communicate technical work to a non-technical audience.

PART 1
In retrospect, the access to information humanity once had was severely underappreciated in its time. When the Internet was unveiled, a decent percentage of even the general public DID know that it would be revolutionary, especially after the proof was very clear in only 2 decades from its inception to mass adoption. Those early generations knew, through experiments in e-mail, instant messaging, e-commerce, and social media, that what they had was a MILLION times better than the world where even the most basic of services was a chore and not free.

Unlike Pro Football Reference, Basketball Reference doesn&rsquo;t have one single page containing every single game that&rsquo;s ever been played. Rather, it is split up into season and months. And that&rsquo;s because over 58 thousand NBA/ABA/BAA games have been played since the inception of professional basketball in 1946.
