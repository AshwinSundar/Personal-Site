      <description>Stop Trying to Catch Ideas It&amp;rsquo;s not a good idea to maximize catching ideas.&#xA;The brain needs time to refresh itself. This is not meant to be a scientific claim by any means, merely a psychological observation. When an idea arrives, don&amp;rsquo;t race to write it down. Chew on it for a while. Let it stew. Turn it into food for thought.&#xA;Even this particular idea right now - that ideas aren&amp;rsquo;t precious - has been with me for some time.</description>

      <description>Django Template Language &amp;ldquo;Front-end&amp;rdquo; in web development refers to the visual appearance of an application or website. In Django, a web development framework, the front-end is created in DTL (Django Template Language), which is a superset of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).&#xA;DTL represents the &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo; of the page - the actual contents. The &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; of the page - how the page appears - is defined by CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).</description>

      <description>Think Slowly January 2024&#xA;I recently purchased a mechanical, ergonomic, and split keyboard1. I love the idea of yet another tech gadget to keep me engaged.&#xA;However, I quickly found myself in over my head. This keyboard is programmable, so the first thing I did was spend several hours tweaking the keys to my exact preference. I soon learned that key placement wouldn&amp;rsquo;t solve my immediate problem - which was the drastic reduction in my typing speed.</description>

      <description>Software I liked in 2023 Here are some software programs I liked1 in 20232.&#xA;mermaid.js - Excellent tool for creating architecture (and other) diagrams from text. Add to a markdown file with special syntax. Renders in GitHub natively. Has some bugs, but team seems to have a good head on its shoulders and should hopefully work them out soon. 8/10&#xA;VSCode - One of the few things Microsoft hasn&amp;rsquo;t totally screwed up yet.</description>

      <description>The Cheap Web Scorecard I recently came across The &amp;ldquo;Cheap&amp;rdquo; Web, a self-described &amp;ldquo;solarpunk philosophy of web design&amp;rdquo;. I highly recommend reading the whole article, for it&amp;rsquo;s both a throwback to what the web used to be, as well as a vision for what the future may hold.&#xA;Towards the end of the article, the author proposes the following measures of cheapness. I decided to rate this website according to those measures.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Indian Philosophy Preamble Thinking, writing, and speaking about any ancient culture using modern English is extremely challenging. A great deal is lost in translation. Many religions, including Hinduism, strongly encourage the study of the religion in the original language. As a child, I learned Hindu slokas in Sanskrit, with only a tenuous understanding of what the phrases meant.&#xA;As a result, I am always hesistant to attempt to describe theories of Bharathiya Darshan, or Indian Philosophy, in English.</description>

      <description>Prefer Markdown I have spent a lot of time writing HTML. I wrote my first HTML when I was around 12 years old. I was obsessed with a website called neopets.com, a website geared for kids to take care of virtual pets. There were games to play, coins to earn, and pets to splurge on. Items could be earned and sold in a &amp;ldquo;shop&amp;rdquo; to other players (for fake currency only).</description>

      <description>Learning Hard Things I took a total of one computer science class in my undergraduate degree. It was a CS class geared towards non-CS majors. The class started at 10AM, which was about 2 hours before my brain started functioning effectively.&#xA;In that class, we were shown many things. Variables! Inputs and outputs! Roman numerals! Classes! As a neuroscience major, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t the faintest clue what the point of any of this was.</description>

      <description>Programming is Engineering Some people say that computer science isn&amp;rsquo;t engineering. They&amp;rsquo;re right. Computer science is the field of first principles, much like physics and chemistry are to mechanical engineering and chemical engineering. Computer science itself is an abstraction layer to another field - mathematics. Depending on what one works on, they may be closer on the spectrum to &amp;ldquo;applied mathematics&amp;rdquo; than &amp;ldquo;computer science&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;This is true for other engineering fields as well.</description>

      <description>The Automonk The Automonk patiently paced the hall, chanting अमर प्रकाश, अंतर्ज्योति in a muted manner that failed to reverbate in the austere marble hall. The phrase, Amar Prakash, Antar Jyoti - Eternal Light, Inner Flame, was derived from analyzing thousands of religious texts and millions of hours of ceremonies through a bespoke neural network designed for the Automonk. Eyes closed, the hooded figure of brass and steel gave the main hall of the monastery a cold, ascetic background noise.</description>

      <description>First Draft: Nov 22 2022&#xA;Second Draft: Jan 17 2023&#xA;PART 1&#xA;In retrospect, the access to information humanity once had was severely underappreciated in its time. When the Internet was unveiled, a decent percentage of even the general public DID know that it would be revolutionary, especially after the proof was very clear in only 2 decades from its inception to mass adoption. Those early generations knew, through experiments in e-mail, instant messaging, e-commerce, and social media, that what they had was a MILLION times better than the world where even the most basic of services was a chore and not free.</description>

Outside of that world, &amp;ldquo;risk management&amp;rdquo; is a bit of a snoozer of a topic. Behind this deceptive veneer lie some valuable tools that could benefit software projects at large, and not just in regulated environments.&#xA;One of these tools is the FMEA, or Failure Modes and Effects Analysis.</description>

      <description>Programming Languages I recently began a Coursera course called &amp;ldquo;Programming Languages&amp;rdquo;, offered by Dan Grossman at the University of Washington. I decided to take this course because the description advertises it as a way to understand the underpinning of all programming languages more thoroughly. When I first learned to program on my own, I always assumed that once I had more experience and learned more languages, I would began to understand the commonalities and differences between programming languages, and that would be sufficient.</description>

      <description>Back to Square One Date: August 1st, 2022&#xA;The original version of this website was written using GatsbyJS, a headless CMS engine that&amp;rsquo;s all the rage right now in the world of web development. After a few weeks, I learned that it was tremendously overkill for a personal website with maybe a few dozen pages (including all my blog posts). Most importantly though, GatsbyJS is bloated with dependencies that take forever for me troubleshoot when all I want to do is add support for MathML.</description>

As they rise through the ranks, they will eventually present their work to larger groups and higher ranks, but the basic lay-person communication task remains the same.</description>

Lewis. As I began exploring theoretical computer science in more detail, I immediately sought out &amp;ldquo;review&amp;rdquo; papers, which I recalled from grad school often provide a great overview of a particular subfield. These papers can be a bit lengthy, but the content is generally pretty digestible compared to culiminating work of a thesis, for example.</description>

      <description>Benchmarking Rust code using Criterion.rs Introduction Benchmarking is a method of systematically assessing a program for performance. This process is a valuable component of regression testing because it helps you compare changes and improvements to your code. The systems programming language Rust offers many statistically rigorous analysis techniques, such as the Criterion crate, which is a popular tool used for benchmarking in Rust. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll go into more detail on how to use Criterion to compare various Rust functions to solve a problem from Project Euler.</description>

      <description>Parallel Processing in Rust Date: April 6th, 2022&#xA;Rust is a systems programming language that is quickly gaining traction at well-known companies including Amazon, Discord, Dropbox, Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft. It is built for performance, reliability, and productivity and has been voted the most loved programming language according to Stack Overflow&amp;rsquo;s Annual Developer Survey since 2016. Some large-scale commercial projects that have been built using Rust include:&#xA;Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s Servo parallel browser engine Discord&amp;rsquo;s Read States service Polkadot&amp;rsquo;s Substrate blockchain engine Figma&amp;rsquo;s Multiplayer service All of these real-world use cases of Rust utilize and benefit from concurrent and parallel processing, which can be daunting to implement on a good day, and pretty terrifying when implemented badly.</description>

      <description>Visualizing NBA Pace Part 1: Inspiration I saw this post and knew immediately that I needed to do something similar for the NBA. However, I had a few things going against me. Unlike Pro Football Reference, Basketball Reference doesn&amp;rsquo;t have one single page containing every single game that&amp;rsquo;s ever been played. Rather, it is split up into season and months. And that&amp;rsquo;s because over 58 thousand NBA/ABA/BAA games have been played since the inception of professional basketball in 1946.</description>
