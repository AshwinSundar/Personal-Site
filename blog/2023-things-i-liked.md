# Software I liked in 2023

Here are some software programs I liked[^caveat] in 2023[^subcaveat].

**mermaid.js** - Excellent tool for creating architecture (and other) diagrams from text. Add to a markdown file with special syntax. Renders in GitHub natively. Has some bugs, but team seems to have a good head on its shoulders and should hopefully work them out soon. <font color = "green">**8/10**</font>

**VSCode** - One of the few things Microsoft hasn't totally screwed up yet. Plug-in ecosystem is enormous. <font color = "green">**9/10**</font>

**Vim** - At the other end of the spectrum. I forced myself to learn keybindings last year and now I can't not use them. I find myself unable to use text editors that lack a "vim mode". 2Bi" - fixed that missing quote! I find the extension ecosystem a bit puzzling still - extensions I install never seem to work quite right. Having to memorize extra keybindings for each plugin maxes out my mental load. <font color = "green">**8/10**</font>

**DigitalOcean** - A breath of fresh air compared to AWS. There are fewer services and quite a lot of abstraction. It fills the gap between walking to work and flying a fighter jet there. DO support has been super prompt and helpful the two times I've contacted them (even on the free support tier). If you need three+ 9's of reliability, call Amazon, Microsoft, or Google. For everything else there's DigitalOcean. <font color = "green">**9/10**</font>

**Django** - The first time I've enjoyed web development in quite some time. The abstraction level can get a bit silly at times, but I find that it's easy to peel back the layers of the onion, so to speak, and troubleshoot the inner workings. I really, really wish that a strongly-typed version of Python could be used. `mypy` and `typeddjango/django-stubs` just don't cut it. I want more compile-time errors! <font color = "green">**8/10**</font>

**Logic Pro** - Technically started using it in late 2021 but really got more into it this year. Used to produce music for a group of friends that play together. Tons of keybindings. Interface can get confusing, but it's a powerful tool. <font color = "green">**9/10**</font>

**regex101.com** - I am _alright_ at constructing regular expressions. I wish I was better. I ordered "Mastering Regular Expressions", but just couldn't get excited about reading 542 pages about regular expressions. If regex101.com didn't exist, this might not have happened:

<figcaption style = 'text-align: center;'>I'm sorry, Mr. Friedl. It's me, not you. <font color = "green">**9/10**</font></figcaption>


**news.ycombinator.com** - A basic message board for the tech cabal. Where [scientism-ists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientism) meet scientific skeptics. If you ever wondered what a world would look like where everyone studies STEM and nothing else, read the comments. If you think all libertarians are smart, read the comments. I enjoy the throwback to the year 2002, never-changing design, and complete lack of an algorithm to recommend news. If you ever wondered what a message board in the [fictional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)) _Three-Body_ video game would be like, this is it[^msg-board]. <font color = "green">**9/10**</font>

[^subcaveat]: Subcaveat: If you, like me, ever found Vim useful, please considering donating to the late Bram Moolenaar's foundation [ICCF Holland](https://www.vim.org/sponsor/index.php).
