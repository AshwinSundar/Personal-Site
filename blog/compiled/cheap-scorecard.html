<h1 id="the-cheap-web-scorecard">The Cheap Web Scorecard</h1>
<p>December 2023</p>
<p>I recently came across <a href="https://potato.cheap/">The ‚ÄúCheap‚Äù
Web</a>, a self-described ‚Äúsolarpunk philosophy of web design‚Äù. I highly
recommend reading the whole article, for it‚Äôs both a throwback to what
the web used to be, as well as a vision for what the future may
hold.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the article, the author proposes the following
measures of cheapness. I decided to rate this website according to those
measures.</p>
<h2 id="cheap-to-maintain">Cheap to maintain</h2>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: <em>Most webpages should work
indefinitely without falling over.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rating: 9/10</strong></p>
<p>This website uses 0 lines of Javascript. It is composed entirely of
HTML and styled with a little bit of CSS. I write articles in Markdown,
which are compiled to HTML using a custom shell script that I maintain.
For deployment, I push to GitHub, where changes are picked up by a
DigitalOcean static-file-deployment application.</p>
<p>If DigitalOcean were to fall over tomorrow, it would probably take
about half a day to either migrate to a new provider, or set up
self-hosting. Given that this is the only potential source of failure I
see for the next several years, I‚Äôd say this site is doing pretty well
on this metric. 4 hours of downtime is not a big deal, because no one
visits this site, like, ever<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<h2 id="cheap-to-leave">Cheap to leave</h2>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: <em>Opting-out of the web should be
painless.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rating: 10/10</strong></p>
<p>How to leave this website:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click the [X] in the top right (or top left on macos)<br />
</li>
<li>Go outside.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="cheap-to-access">Cheap to access</h2>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: <em>Most websites should be compatible
with screenreaders, etc.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rating: 8/10</strong></p>
<p>Reader-view looks pretty good for the blog posts. I think I missed a
few <code>&lt;alt&gt;</code> tags for images here and there though. I
don‚Äôt know how to make <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tags compatible with a
screenreader. And the index page doesn‚Äôt seem to be reader-friendly for
some reason.</p>
<h2 id="cheap-to-participate">Cheap to participate</h2>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: <em>Interacting with the web should be
possible on a Wii.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rating: 10/10</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser)">Lynx</a>,
a terminal-based web browser that predates Mosaic, is still alive and
kicking. Here‚Äôs what this site looks like:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>&gt; lynx https://ashwinsundar.com</code></pre>
<img title = "ashwinsundar.com in Lynx 2023" alt = "ashwinsundar.com in Lynx 2023" src = "/blog/assets/cheap-scorecard/lynx.png">
<figcaption style="text-align: center;">
ashwinsundar.com in Lynx 2023
</figcaption>
<p>That‚Äôs pretty usable. Someone with the cheapest computer and slowest
internet connection can still read my inane thoughts and musings.</p>
<h2 id="cheap-to-explore">Cheap to explore</h2>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: <em>Exploring the web should be pleasant
on 1W of power.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rating: ?/10</strong></p>
<p>I don‚Äôt own a computing device that runs on 1W of power. The Energy
tab in macos‚Äôs Activity Monitor shows this:</p>
<img title = "florbs of power used by ashwinsundar.com" alt = "florbs of power used by ashwinsundar.com" src = "/blog/assets/cheap-scorecard/energy.png">
<figcaption style="text-align: center;">
Florbs of power used by ashwinsundar.com
</figcaption>
<p>Helpfully, Apple decided that including units in this table was too
confusing for the average Mac user. So we are only left to wonder how
many units of energy Firefox uses when it is opened to this site.</p>
<h2 id="cheap-to-contribute">Cheap to contribute</h2>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: <em>Making/hosting websites should be
easier than scrapbooking.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rating: 10/10</strong></p>

<p>The main takeaway is that the simplicity of this site enabled it to
score well on this ‚ÄúCheap Web‚Äù scorecard. In the areas that could be
rated, it averaged a 9.4/10. This site could use improvements in the
area of accessibility, which will be very easy to make thanks to how
simple the site is.</p>
