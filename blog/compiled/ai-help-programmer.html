<p><strong>February 2023</strong></p>
<p>I am attempting to solve a homework problem that asks me to write a
helper function to use in a later problem. I have gotten 95% of the way
there with this function, written in Standard ML:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode sml"><code class="sourceCode sml"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">fun</span> longest_string_helper f sl =</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    foldl (<span class="kw">fn</span> (next, acc) =&gt; <span class="kw">if</span> f (next, acc) <span class="kw">then</span> acc <span class="kw">else</span> next) <span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span> sl</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The purpose of this function is to take a function <code>f</code> and
apply something called a <strong>left fold</strong> across each element
of the list <em>sl</em>. Each answer is stored in an
<strong>accumulator</strong>, which is instantiated to the empty
string.</p>
<p>A hint in the homework suggested that the function signature for this
problem should be:</p>
<p><code>val longest_string_helper = fn : (int * int -&gt; bool) -&gt; string list -&gt; string</code></p>
<p>However, the function I wrote has a function signature of:</p>
<p><code>val longest_string_helper = fn : (string * string -&gt; bool) -&gt; string list -&gt; string</code></p>
<p>The function passed in accepts a tuple <code>(string, string)</code>,
when it should accept a tuple <code>(int, int)</code>.</p>
<p>I changed the initial accumulator value to <code>0</code>, but this
changed the function signature to
<code>(int * int -&gt; bool) -&gt; int list -&gt; int</code>. The
passed-in function’s signature was correct, but the remaining elements
of the overall signature were wrong. I tried various other minor
changes, with no luck. I knew the answer was within reach, but I
couldn’t find it.</p>
<p>After about two hours of reading notes, class forums, and an intense
internet search, I finally resorted to asking ChatGPT-3. In the past, it
has struggled to provide correct advice about Standard ML. So I warily
asked it for help:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/assets/ai-help-programmer/screenshot1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 1280px;"/></p>
<p>Right away, the answer is wrong. ChatGPT-3 seems to think the
signature for the passed-in function is a tuple of any-type
<code>'a</code> and <code>string</code> returning a <code>bool</code>,
when this clearly was not the case. I next asked a follow-up
question:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/assets/ai-help-programmer/screenshot2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 1280px;"/></p>
<p>This answer is close! The homework does not permit using this
<code>size</code> function, but it does permit <code>String.size</code>.
The function signature is now correct after making these
modifications:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode sml"><code class="sourceCode sml"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">fun</span> longest_string_helper f sl =</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    foldl (<span class="kw">fn</span> (next,acc) =&gt; <span class="kw">if</span> f (String.size next, String.size acc) <span class="kw">then</span> acc <span class="kw">else</span> next) <span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span> sl</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The function signature is now
<code>val longest_string_helper = fn : (int * int -&gt; bool) -&gt; string list -&gt; string</code>.</p>
<hr />
<p>I learned the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Try to solve the problem without assistance - just use your
brain.</li>
<li>Re-read your notes and all available class resources to gain further
insight into the problem.</li>
<li>If AI assistance must be used, learn everything possible about the
final solution. In my case, I wrote this short report :)</li>
