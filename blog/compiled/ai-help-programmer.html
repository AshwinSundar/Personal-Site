<p>I am attempting to solve a homework problem that asks me to write a
helper function to use in a later problem. I have gotten 95% of the way
there with this function, written in Standard ML:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode sml"><code class="sourceCode sml"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">fun</span> longest_string_helper f sl =</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    foldl (<span class="kw">fn</span> (next, acc) =&gt; <span class="kw">if</span> f (next, acc) <span class="kw">then</span> acc <span class="kw">else</span> next) <span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span> sl</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The purpose of this function is to take a function <em>f</em> and
apply something called a <strong>left fold</strong> across each element
of the list <em>sl</em>. Each answer is stored in an
<strong>accumulator</strong>, which is instantiated to the empty
string.</p>
<p>A hint in the homework suggested that the function signature for this
problem should be <em>val longest_string_helper = fn : (int * int -&gt;
bool) -&gt; string list -&gt; string</em>. However, the function I wrote
has a function signature of <em>val longest_string_helper = fn : (string
* string -&gt; bool) -&gt; string list -&gt; string</em>. The function
passed in accepts a tuple <em>(string, string)</em>, when it should
accept a tuple <em>(int, int)</em>.</p>
<p>I changed the initial accumulator value to <em>0</em>, but this
changed the function signature to <em>(int </em> int -&gt; bool) -&gt;
int list -&gt; int*. The passed-in function’s signature was correct, but
now remaining elements of the overall signature were wrong. I tried
various other minor changes, with no luck. I knew the answer was within
reach, but I couldn’t find it.</p>
<p>After about two hours of reading notes, class forums, and an intense
internet search, I finally resorted to asking ChatGPT-3. In the past, it
has struggled to provide correct advice about Standard ML. So I warily
asked it for help:</p>

<p>Right away, it is wrong. It seems to think the signature for the
passed-in function is a tuple of <em>any-type a</em> and <em>string</em>
returning a <em>bool</em>, when I saw this was not the case. So I
decided to press on and ask a follow-up question:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/assets/ai-help-programmer/screenshot2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 1280px;"/></p>
<p>This answer is close! The homework does not permit using this
<em>size</em> function, but it does permit <em>String.size</em>. The
function signature is now correct after making these modifications:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode sml"><code class="sourceCode sml"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">fun</span> longest_string_helper f sl =</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    foldl (<span class="kw">fn</span> (next,acc) =&gt; <span class="kw">if</span> f (String.size next, String.size acc) <span class="kw">then</span> acc <span class="kw">else</span> next) <span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span> sl</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The function signature is now <em>val longest_string_helper = fn :
(int </em> int -&gt; bool) -&gt; string list -&gt; string*.</p>

<p>What did I learn? First, try to solve the problem without assistance
- just use your brain. Second, re-read your notes and all available
class resources to gain further insight into the problem. Finally, if AI
assistance must be used, learn everything possible about the final
solution. In my case, I wrote this short report :)</p>
