<h1 id="programming-languages">Programming Languages</h1>
<p>Date: October 2022</p>
<p>I recently began a Coursera course called “Programming Languages”,
offered by Dan Grossman at the University of Washington. I decided to
take this course because the description advertises it as a way to
understand the underpinning of all programming languages more
thoroughly. When I first learned to program on my own, I always assumed
that once I had more experience and learned more languages, I would
began to understand the commonalities and differences between
programming languages, and that would be sufficient. However, I am
realizing that while I do have more experience now, I still lack the big
picture view that I desire. Learning Rust made me realize that there is
a LOT more to the theory of programming languages than I ever
imagined.</p>
<p>I always saw a language as a means to an end - it was merely a tool
for creating a program that does something. But a programming language,
much like human language, has its own intrinsic meaning, independent of
any semantics that are assigned when used in the confines of a
particular application.</p>
<p>When I learned programming on my own, I encountered a dizzying number
of schools of thoughts on how code should be written, how programs
should be modularized, and even what languages should be used. I
dismissed a lot of this as pedagogical and irrelevant to my real-world
needs of operating a microcontroller or creating a web interface. Why
does it matter what C++ is good at, when all that is available to me at
work is Javascript?</p>
<p>In retrospect, my view was justified, but myopic. My definition of
utility for the first several years of my career was whether I could use
it for my job or a side-project I was interested in. But as I’ve started
in my new role in consulting, I’m finding myself switching between
projects in completely different industries every 6 months to a year,
which is giving me a chance to work in totally different code-bases and
languages. Furthermore, I am exposed (via my colleagues on other
projects) to far more languages and schools of thought than I was
previously.</p>
<p>This has resulted in me becoming particularly interested in the
theory of computer science at large, and not just in terms of what is
immediately useful to me. I recognize that I have NO IDEA what I’ll be
working on in 6 months, and as a result everything in CS is potentially
useful. This has made the entire field very interesting to me. I get
excited by the potential that something I learn now could be useful in
the near future. Or it might not be. In which case I can write an
article about it.</p>
<p>So anyway, back to the point - Programming Languages is tying things
together for me. For example, I just watched a lecture on Options, and
recalled the days I spent attempting to understand this bizarre
<code>Option</code> type in Rust that I kept encountering. It bewildered
me because I had never seen such a concept, and it just seemed like a
pain to keep wrapping and unwrapping data. Why can’t I just access it
directly?</p>
<p>The reason for this was more subtle than I could appreciate at the
time - I merely saw Rust as a tool to learn so that I could access
cooler job opportunities. What I am now appreciating with this course is
that languages have intrinsic value. The Option type is a better tool
for handling code exceptions, where I might have chose to use a switch
statement previously. Sure, the flathead screwdriver worked for prying
open a panel in my car, but the <code>Option</code> tool is more
graceful in the way that a plastic pry device. It is purpose-built. It
causes less damage to the underlying structure you are working with.</p>
<p>As I continue through this course, I will update this article.</p>
<p>December 2022</p>
<p>I have completed half of course 1 and feel like I have a better
understanding of the course motivation.</p>
<p>Lecture notes: There is no such thing as the <strong>best</strong>
programming language, just like there is no such thing as the
<strong>best</strong> car. Programming languages, like anything else,
are designed to optimize some aspects at the expense of others. To
extend the analogy, mechanics might focus on certain types of cars, just
like programmers might prefer some cars over others. A good mechanic
might have a specialty he prefers, but he generally understands how
“cars” (not certain makes/models) work. He won’t refuse to work on a car
because the upholstery is blue (kind of similar to how to programmers
bicker about syntax, an unessential detail). A good mechanical engineer
knows how cars work, how to get the most out of them, and how to design
better ones. Similar analogy to a programming language reseasrcher.</p>
<p>Older cars (languages) sometimes are better because they are simpler
and easier to understand. Popularity in and of itself is not evidence of
being the “best”. Software development is precise, you don’t get to just
guess at how semantics work. You’ll sound stupid if you say “I feel that
conditional expressions might work like this”.</p>
<p>Idioms make you a better programmer - you can infer how any language
works if you understand basic constructs deeply. Booleans, conditional
expressions are deep eternal truths about logic. It could be called
“first principles” in another world - they hold true regardless of the
environment. Understanding programming languages at this level won’t get
you a better job right away, but they lay a great foundation and enable
you to better understand the field as a whole.</p>
<p>April 2023</p>
<p>After some delay I’ve completed Part A. Beyond the course syllabus,
here is what I’ve learned so far:</p>
<p> - Programming languages are far more than tools. They are
applications of computer science theory. They are conduits of ideas from
applied mathematics. There is far more to them than meets the eye. A
very human element exists to designing a good programming language -
it’s an exercise that blends engineering and art.</p>
<p>Starting Part B of the course, the first lesson includes the
following statement that I found enlightening:</p>
<p>*For some reason, HTML is only rarely criticized for being littered
with parentheses but it is a common complaint leveled against LISP,
Scheme, and Racket. If you stop a programmer on the street and ask him
or her about these languages, they may well say something about “all
those parentheses.” This is a bizarre obsession: people who use these
languages quickly get used to it and find the uniform syntax pleasant.
For example, it makes it very easy for the editor to indent your code
properly.<br />
From the standpoint of learning about programming languages and
fundamental programming constructs, you should recognize a strong
opinion about parentheses (either for or against) as a syntactic
prejudice. While everyone is entitled to a personal opinion on syntax,
one should not allow it to keep you from learning advanced ideas that
Racket does well, like hygienic macros or abstract datatypes in a
dynamically typed language or first-class continuations. An analogy
would be if a student of European history did not want to learn about
the French Revolution because he or she was not attracted to people with
french accents.</p>
<p>Coming into this class, one misconception I hold is that static typed
languages are superior to dynamic typed languages. Static typing is for
programmers who know what they’re doing and can reason about a program
sufficiently. Dynamic typing is for programmers who want to get
something working quickly, and leave bugs to the client to deal with. I
think my understanding of dynamically typed languages is shaky at best
as a result.</p>
