<h1 id="programming-languages">Programming Languages</h1>
<p>Date: October 2022</p>
<p>I recently began a Coursera course called “Programming Languages”,
offered by Dan Grossman at the University of Washington. I decided to
take this course because the description advertises it as a way to
understand the underpinning of all programming languages more
thoroughly. When I first learned to program on my own, I always assumed
that once I had more experience and learned more languages, I would
began to understand the commonalities and differences between
programming languages, and that would be sufficient. However, I am
realizing that while I do have more experience now, I still lack the big
picture view that I desire. Learning Rust made me realize that there is
a LOT more to the theory of programming languages than I ever
imagined.</p>
<p>I always saw a language as a means to an end - it was merely a tool
for creating a program that does something. But a programming language,
much like human language, has its own intrinsic meaning, independent of
any semantics that are assigned when used in the confines of a
particular application.</p>
<p>When I learned programming on my own, I encountered a dizzying number
of schools of thoughts on how code should be written, how programs
should be modularized, and even what languages should be used. I
dismissed a lot of this as pedagogical and irrelevant to my real-world
needs of operating a microcontroller or creating a web interface. Why
does it matter what C++ is good at, when all that is available to me at
work is Javascript?</p>
<p>In retrospect, my view was justified, but myopic. My definition of
utility for the first several years of my career was whether I could use
it for my job or a side-project I was interested in. But as I’ve started
in my new role in consulting, I’m finding myself switching between
projects in completely different industries every 6 months to a year,
which is giving me a chance to work in totally different code-bases and
languages. Furthermore, I am exposed (via my colleagues on other
projects) to far more languages and schools of thought than I was
previously.</p>
<p>This has resulted in me becoming particularly interested in the
theory of computer science at large, and not just in terms of what is
immediately useful to me. I recognize that I have NO IDEA what I’ll be
working on in 6 months, and as a result everything in CS is potentially
useful. This has made the entire field very interesting to me. I get
excited by the potential that something I learn now could be useful in
the near future. Or it might not be. In which case I can write an
article about it.</p>
<p>So anyway, back to the point - Programming Languages is tying things
together for me. For example, I just watched a lecture on Options, and
recalled the days I spent attempting to understand this bizarre
<code>Option</code> type in Rust that I kept encountering. It bewildered
me because I had never seen such a concept, and it just seemed like a
pain to keep wrapping and unwrapping data. Why can’t I just access it
directly?</p>
<p>The reason for this was more subtle than I could appreciate at the
time - I merely saw Rust as a tool to learn so that I could access
cooler job opportunities. What I am now appreciating with this course is
that languages have intrinsic value. The Option type is a better tool
for handling code exceptions, where I might have chose to use a switch
statement previously. Sure, the flathead screwdriver worked for prying
open a panel in my car, but the <code>Option</code> tool is more
graceful in the way that a plastic pry device. It is purpose-built. It
causes less damage to the underlying structure you are working with.</p>
<p>As I continue through this course, I will update this article.</p>
