<p>First Draft: Nov 22 2022<br />
Second Draft: Jan 17 2023</p>
<p>PART 1<br />
In retrospect, the access to information humanity once had was severely
underappreciated in its time. When the Internet was unveiled, a decent
percentage of even the general public DID know that it would be
revolutionary, especially after the proof was very clear in only 2
decades from its inception to mass adoption. Those early generations
knew, through experiments in e-mail, instant messaging, e-commerce, and
social media, that what they had was a MILLION times better than the
world where even the most basic of services was a chore and not
free.</p>
<p><strong>The Internet</strong> was a miracle in the truest sense. It
made the effort of shopping free. You no longer had to load the family
up in the car that you purchased, burn gas that you also purchased on
your way to a parking lot to buy a ticket, walk into a store and
purchase food and ice cream for the kids, go to the shop to buy that
item that you desperately need, and then go home. The internet made it
so all you had to was the last thing.</p>
<p>So everyone knew, probably up until the mid 50s of the 21st century.
At that point, it became a bit like the memories of war that the general
public had - none of which was first-hand anymore. There hadn’t been a
draft in the United States since the early 1970s, which was ancient
history to this generation. The Pullman Peace Accord of 2031 had been
obeyed to a T for nearly 30 years. World peace was real, for all intents
and purposes.</p>
<p>Every service and good had been abstracted away from reality -
meaning everything could be done in some form or fashion, but virtually.
When this abstraction first came launched as a consumer product, it had
a hokey name called the “Metaverse”. It was ridiculed so badly that a
company named Meta effectively lost all credibility and dissolved into
obscurity. But there remained fragments of the idea, in the form of
thought leaders, and each of those leaders and their ideas was absorbed
by every other tech conglomerate of the time. The idea of an abstract
reality metastasized in every conglomerate in a unique way, and they
each began constructing the massive existence that we now know today as
<strong>The Shell</strong>.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with SPG (Shell Petrogas), a former oil
conglomerate turned minor player in the Nickel Wars, The Shell is the
form of existence many people select for themselves now. It’s an
“alternate reality”, to put it another way. But why was The Shell
invented? What was the market factor? A change came upon the general
populace, some believe in the early 2010s, that could best be
characterized as “generalizable apathy”.</p>
<p>Various measures of civic engagement had begun to decline. Voting
rates dropped. Social media addiction in pre-teens began manifesting
themselves in massively increasing suicide rates. The company known as
Meta seized the opportunity and created a world for these people. Their
first foray into social media involved an alternate reality of this
type, a flat-screen network called “The Facebook”. Users accessed this
network through a personal computing device, which were large, bulky
affairs that required enormous power consumption. Shell Petrogas (then
known as Royal Dutch Shell) was a major provider of the toxic raw
materials for electricity at the time, mainly petroleum and related
products. It is still unknown whether Meta and Shell Petrogas ever
colluded on this matter to boost their profits.</p>
<p>This generalizable apathy was like a horcrux. It needed a host to
latch onto. It pickedo social media and never let go. Facebook, which
Meta was simply known as back then, exploited self-reinforcing dopamine
pathways in the human central nervous system to encourage addictive
behavior towards their platforms. Ex-employees interviewed at the time
admitted to as much.</p>
<p>Hence, our predicament today. The Shell is estimated to consume 86%
of humanity’s total hours. The average human being spends over 20 hours
per day inside the Shell. Merely 4 hours per day for bodily functions or
unaided sleep. The number of RTIs (Reticular Temporal Implants) in the
average adult exceeded 10 for the first time in 2083, with Striatal
Spectrum Incorporated, an advertising giant, accounting for
approximately 2 in 10 RTIs per person.</p>
<p>Society no longer believed that technological advancement needed to
be accomplished by humans. Artificial intelligence of sufficient quality
had been developed by the mid 2020s, and the vast majority of
knowledge-based jobs no longer needed to be completed by humans. The
number of students entering academia and research dropped by 50% from
2030 to 2050, and never stopped declining. Most people simply believed
that all technological advancement could be accomplished by AI, but AI
could only be trained to perform at the maximum capability of humanity,
not any greater. Researchers never solved that problem, and as their
profession dwindled, they could not progress quickly enough to solve the
problems that humanity faced.</p>
<p>By 2150, humanity had lost its ability to progress further, and began
the <strong>Great Descent</strong>. Techniques were forgotten. Religion
and culture were discarded as inefficiencies. Massive infrastructure
projects ran out of raw resources, and entire power grids shut down
permanently. The population slowly de-skilled and outsourced their
knowledge to artificial intelligence, instead opting to spend more time
in the Shell. Literal mountains of waste were created of the
technological products that humanity no longer could operate.</p>
