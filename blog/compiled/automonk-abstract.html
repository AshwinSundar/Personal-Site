<h1 id="the-automonk">The Automonk</h1>
<p>The <i>Automonk</i> patiently paced the hall, chanting
<font color="green">अमर प्रकाश, अंतर्ज्योति</font> in a muted manner that
failed to reverbate in the austere marble hall. The phrase, <i>Amar
Prakash, Antar Jyoti - Eternal Light, Inner Flame</i>, was derived from
analyzing thousands of religious texts and millions of hours of
ceremonies through a bespoke neural network designed for the
<i>Automonk</i>. Eyes closed, the hooded figure of brass and steel gave
the main hall of the monastery a cold, ascetic background noise. A
couple of small groups of devotees sat equidistantly apart, some
reverently conversing, others with eyes closed and prayer beads in hand.
The whine of the air conditioning was faintly audible, otherwise, no
other noise permeated the hall.</p>
