<h1 id="review---ideas-that-created-the-future">Review - Ideas that
Created the Future</h1>
<p>Date: July 31st, 2022</p>
<p>In late July 2022, I began reading an excellent book called <em>Ideas
that Created the Future - Classic Papers of Computer Science</em> by
Harry R. Lewis. As I began exploring theoretical computer science in
more detail, I immediately sought out “review” papers, which I recalled
from grad school often provide a great overview of a particular
subfield. These papers can be a bit lengthy, but the content is
generally pretty digestible compared to culiminating work of a thesis,
for example. A format like <em>Ideas that Created the Future</em> is
ideal for someone new to theoretical computer science, such as myself.
I’ve always been a huge fan of history, because I need the context of
where an idea fits in time relative to the rest of its field. In
<em>Ideas that Created the Future</em>, Lewis provides a brief
introduction to each article to place it correctly in history and offer
context to what challenges the author was facing and trying to
solve.</p>
<p>As I read this book, I’m summarizing my thoughts on some of the
papers as well. So here is my review of Lewis’s review of all of these
influential papers. In some cases I pull straight from the article
itself and let the quote stand on its own.</p>
<h2 id="the-true-method---gottfried-wilhelm-leibniz-1677"><em>The True
Method</em> - Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, 1677</h2>
<p>I believe that the purpose of this writing by Leibniz is to extract
the value of logical reasoning from mathematics and generalize the
concept to everyday arguments. He seeks this extrapolation so that the
merits of an argument can be evaluated independently of who speaks the
words or how they utter them. This final sentence was originally an
ambition of Aristotle’s, which I vaguely deciphered from <em>Prior
Analytics</em>.</p>
<p>This article was naively inspiring, a phrase I just made up that I
hope has a positive connotation. Lebniz is optimistic that humanity can
communicate infallibly through a language that is impossible to hide
falsehood in.</p>
<h2
id="babbages-analytical-engine---luigi-federico-menabrea-1843"><em>Babbage’s
Analytical Engine</em> - Luigi Federico Menabrea, 1843</h2>
<p><em>Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace trod the spectacular wilderness
of the field, but the shortcomings of their technology and the passage
of time largely obliterated the path they blazed until others began to
follow it again…</em></p>
<p>The analytical engine designed by Babbage and idealized by Lovelace
was ultimately unable to be built, because of the lack of precision
machining available in their day. This was another fascinating and
inspiring article (actually a series of lectures, written up by Menabrea
and annotated by Ada Lovelace). Babbage envisions a techno-utopia, like
Leibniz.</p>
<h2
id="an-investigation-of-the-laws-of-thought-on-which-are-founded-the-mathematical-theories-of-logic-and-probability--george-boole-1854"><em>An
Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the
Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probability</em>- George Boole,
1854</h2>
<p>First of all - the boolean variable is named after George Boole. How
cool is that. He sought to reduce logic to the algebra of true and
false.</p>
<p>This article is written in an interesting style. It feels laborious
to read, only because there is so much to unpack from almost every
sentence. However, the reader is rewarded generously for taking the time
to understand every paragraph.</p>
<p>I found the following statement insightful, from 4.3.16 page 38:</p>
<p><em>(The Principle of Contradiction)…it is impossible for any being
to possess a quality, and at the same time not possess it.</em></p>
<p>This is expressed by:</p>
<p><span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>x</em></span></p>
<p><span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup> − <em>x</em> = 0</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>x</em>(1−<em>x</em>) = 0</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is the entity
(i.e. being), and <span class="math inline">(1−<em>x</em>)</span> is NOT
the entity. The intersection of the entity and not the entity is
precisely <span class="math inline">0</span>.</p>
<p>Still reading this article, and will finish writing it up here
later.</p>
