<p>Programming is Engineering</p>
<p>April 2023</p>
<p>Some people say that computer science isn’t engineering. They’re
right. Computer science is the field of first principles, much like
physics and chemistry are to mechanical engineering and chemical
engineering. Computer science itself is an abstraction layer to another
field - mathematics. Depending on what one works on, they may be closer
on the spectrum to “applied mathematics” than “computer science”.</p>
<p>This is true for other engineering fields as well. Some mechanical
engineers are closer to physics than others, perhaps just by the nature
of their industry. Same with chemical engineers.</p>
<p>Software engineering is, of course, the applied portion of computer
science. That also makes it the “applied applied” portion of
mathematics. Programmers talk about <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_layer">abstraction
layers</a> in languages. They are by far the leading experts in all
fields of creating and thinking about abstraction layers. They are so
good at it, that they’ve turn their entire field into an abstraction
layer itself.</p>
