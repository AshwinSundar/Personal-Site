<p>Date: August 1st, 2022</p>
<p>The original version of this website was written using GatsbyJS, a
headless CMS engine that’s all the rage right now in the world of web
development. After a few weeks, I learned that it was tremendously
overkill for a personal website with maybe a few dozen pages (including
all my blog posts). Most importantly though, GatsbyJS is bloated with
dependencies that take forever for me troubleshoot when all I want to do
is add support for MathML.</p>
<p>The zipped, compressed, ready-to-deploy GatsbyJS package is 18.6
MEGABYTES. For a couple dozen pages. It’s nuts. I’m a little scared of
looking at how big the uncompressed source code is…<em>waiting for Mac
Finder to calculate size</em>…1.03 GIGABYTES for 62 THOUSAND items???
Are you kidding me??? How many NPM modules do I need to run this tiny
site???</p>
<p>I got fed up with learning what I consider non-value-add information
about a fad-ish website-building engine, and decided to go back to
basics.</p>
<p>I threw it all away. I got a bit overzealous, and threw away
Javascript too. That’s right - this site is written entirely in HTML and
CSS. That’s it. This decision was driven partially about seeking the
most minimal toolset possible (which I believe I have achieved), and
also by my disdain for the anti-intellectual patterns present in
Javascript and the community. But who knows, maybe I’ll bring back
Javascript. Or maybe I’ll hook this site up to Rust + WebAssembly, a
side project I’ve wanted to pursue for a while now anyways.</p>
<p>I also plan to working in software development for a while, and will
likely own this website for decades of my working lifetime. I want
something that’s future-proof. I can guarantee that exactly 0 of the
popular frameworks today will be popular (or even exist) in 10-20 years.
Who knows what will be popular then. I don’t care, to be honest. And I
don’t have to, because HTML and CSS are here forever.</p>
