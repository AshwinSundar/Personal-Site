<h1 id="think-slowly">Think Slowly</h1>
<p>January 2024</p>
<p>I recently purchased a mechanical, ergonomic, and split keyboard<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. I love the idea of yet another tech
gadget to keep me engaged.</p>
<p>However, I quickly found myself in over my head. This keyboard is
programmable, so the first thing I did was spend several hours tweaking
the keys to my exact preference. I soon learned that key placement
wouldn’t solve my immediate problem - which was the drastic reduction in
my typing speed. I went from typing 100+ words-per-minute on a regular
flat membrane keyboard, to a paltry 20 words-per-minute and barely able
to scratch 95% accuracy.</p>
<p>After a few days, I was wondering if I had made a mistake. I tried to
switch back to my regular keyboard, but was surprised to find I could no
longer operate it effectively either. The only option left was to fully
immerse in this new typing experience.</p>
<p>As a developer, I use <code>vim</code> keybindings a lot. Having
mentally-mapped various keybindings to locations on the keyboard, I now
had to painfully recall the actual key for each binding, find the
location of the new key, and then precisely tap it with the correct
finger.</p>
<p>Learning to use this keyboard has been a triple learning curve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning to use the correct finger for each key in an ortholinear
layout</li>
<li>Learning the locations of vim keybindings and chorded commands</li>
<li>Learning to depress mechanical keys, which behave very differently
from the flat membrane keys of most modern consumer keyboards</li>
</ul>
<p>I am attempting to enjoy the process. One thing I’ve noticed is the
reduced pace at which I can record my thoughts. This slowed-down process
gives me more time to carefully select words for each sentence. It
encourages brevity of expression.</p>
<p>In general, I have found myself thinking more slowly. When I was
younger, I was in a rush to get ideas out of my head, to the point of
lacking logic or cohesion. This bewildered friends and family. Over
time, I found my ideas developing more slowly, but far more efficiently;
and eventually reaching a lucid form, ready to share with the world.</p>
<p>I may never return to that previous record of 120 words-per-minute.
My current pace of about 35 words-per-minute is rather agonizing.
Hopefully I achieve a happy medium.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Also, the key layout is <a

and the keycaps are blank. I really did myself no favors buying this
thing. But the lights and clacky noises are pretty sweet!<a
